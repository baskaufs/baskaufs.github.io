<p>Philip Snyder and his wife Catharina Jacobi were both born in Germantown, 
Columbia Co., New York.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>&nbsp; They were descendants 
of the many Germans who came to the American colonies as a part of the great 
Palatinate migration in 1710.&nbsp; (Family tradition had said that Philip was a 
native of Germany.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>)&nbsp; Philip and Catharina were 
married on 11 Aug 1771.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>&nbsp; The names of all of 
their children are not known but are thought to include:<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Wilhelm Snyder&nbsp; b. c.1771<br>
<a href="1.htm">Philip Snyder, Jr.&nbsp; 17 Jan 1782 - c.1824, m. Mary 
Sharpsteen</a></p>

<p>There has been speculation that <a href="s1.htm">Peter Snyder (b. c.1793)</a> 
may have also been a son, but thus far this remains speculation.&nbsp; A 
Benjamin Snyder is also associated with Philip Snyder, Jr. but his connection is 
unknown.<sup><a href="#4">4</a> <a href="#5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>For the time being I am presenting a pedigree sheet<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> 
that outlines the ancestries of Philip Snyder, Sr. and Catharina Jacobi Snyder.&nbsp; None of the 
information is currently documented here, but I will try to add references as I 
get then and time allows.&nbsp; </p>

&quot;Town of Candice History&quot; from History of Ontario Co., NY, 1878, p.253-258</a>&nbsp; 
&quot;In 1815, Benjamin, Peter, and Philip Snyder came to Ball Hill. The first took 
the REMY place, Peter the WHITBECK farm, and Philip the east portion of the 
lands of the brothers Orlando G. and Andrew BROWN. … Philip Snyder sold to D. 
ADAMS in 1838, and from him title descended to Ira MERRILLS and Jairus COLEGROVE, 
who sold to the brothers named. Benjamin Snyder sold to E. MACOMBER and H. 
GREEN. J. DAVIDSON, S. PHIPPS, S. R. HICKOK, and J. DEWEY were successive owners 
prior to John REMY, the present possessor. Peter Snyder and Captain GRANBY, a 
sea-captain in the war of 1812, were almost simultaneous settlers on this farm. 
The captain soon died. SNYDER sold to John CHAMBERLIN, he to I. W. MITCHELL, and 
Hart and Murray, Isaac GIFFORD, and Jacob WHITBECK…&quot;.&nbsp; Note: In New York, a 
&quot;town&quot; represents a subdivision of a county (analogous to a township) and not a 
settlement or village.&nbsp; A potential problem with this history is that it 
says that Philip Snyder sold to D. Adams in 1838. We know from Peter Snyder's 
(b. 1820) history that his father Philip Snyder died in about 1824. However, it 
is possible that this indicates that the heirs of Philip Snyder (i.e. his wife 
Mary) sold the land in 1838.</font></p>
