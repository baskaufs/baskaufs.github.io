<p><font size="2"><a name="3"></a>3. In the <a href="images/notes/143-2.gif">letter from Frank G. Lewis (1919)</a>, 
Mr. Lewis relates the following story connecting William (b. 1796) to Samuel (b. 
1795): &quot;I cannot tell you how interesting it is to read in your letter the 
tradition that three Bassetts came directly from England, settled in New York, 
one was drowned, one went to Michigan or Wisconsin, and the third was your great 
grandfather who wnet to Ohio. With this I will put some items that are likewise 
intesting. How dependable they are you can judge as I tell how I picked them up. 
In the summer of 1915 I visited my mother's youngest brother at West 
Clarksville, New York, and talked with him particularly to see what I could, by 
all the questions I could think of, recall of his early days and what he used to 
hear said. His father, my grandfather Jesse B. Payne, died in 1857. His mother, 
my grandmother Mary Ann (Bassett) Payne, was a daughter of William Bassett, 
whose wife was Susannah (Livingston) Bassett. they moved from New York to Allen 
county, Ohio, about 1856, or the beginning of 1857. In the winter of 1857-1858, 
after my grandfather Payne died, Grandmother Mary Ann (Bassett) Payne went to 
Allen county with her younger children, whon of whom was my uncle, Newell Jasper 
Payne, whom I visited in 1915. He was born in 1848, and so was nearly nine years 
old at the time the trip was made. He remembered very distinctly how they went 
to Lima and then went out a few miles to the home of an &quot;uncle,&quot; on the way to 
the home of his grandfather, William Bassett, who then, or at least at the time 
of the census of 1860, was living in the town of Sugar Creek, Putnam county, his 
post office being recorded as Vaughnsville (which may very likely appear quite 
curious to you from the point of view of present geography). Now I am very sure 
that &quot;uncle&quot; was uncle for his mother and that this &quot;uncle&quot; was a brother of his 
grandfather William Bassett, in other words, that this &quot;uncle&quot; was your great 
grandfather Samuel Bassett. Here the tradition you have that a Bassett went to 
Michigan, or Wisconsin, is interesting, for William Bassett, brother of your 
great grandfather went on into Michigan, spent the last years of his life at the 
home of his son Philo C. Bassett, at Ovid, Mich, where the son had gone before 
1860; and there William died Mar. 7, 1867. The son Philo C. afterward went to 
Detroit, died there in 1900, and is buried in Ovid. Descendents of William now 
live in Michigan.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><a name="4"></a>4. A letter from Charlou Dolan to Lois Bassett 
11 Feb 1985 states that a Joab Bassett who married Lucy Robbins lived in 
Chenango Co., NY and was buried in the &quot;Rhode Island Cemetery&quot; there. This may 
be a son of William (b. c.1765).</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><a name="5"></a>5. In <a href="images/notes/143-3.gif">Lewis, 1919</a>, he notes that a Lewis 
Bassett lived next door to William (b. c.1765) and might have been his son. 
There is no record of him after than and Mr. Lewis speculates that this might 
have been the brother who was said to have drowned. </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><a name="6"></a>6. Mariah (Bassett) Wood and her husband 
Harmon Wood were early settlers in northern Bath Township, Allen County, OH. 
However, the names of her parents have never been determined. </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><a name="8"></a>8. The family's move to New York soon after 
1800 is supported by the confusion about Samuel's birthplace in the census 
records. Although born in Rhode Island and living in Vermont at an early age, 
Samuel's birthplace is listed as New York in 1850 and &quot;Mass.&quot; in 1860. A move to 
New York around 1800 would have meant that Samuel would have only been about 
five years old at the time and not likely to have had a clear memory of these 
earlier places of residence. (Massachusetts is the probable origin of Samuel's 
wife's family.) To add to the confusion, Samuel's son, Lewis was listed as born 
in New Jersey in the 1870 census and he was certainly born in New York. This 
makes it clear that the combination of lack of written records, illiteracy, and 
interview of family members other than the person in question resulted in 
inaccuracies in census birth places in these situations where families moved 
repeatedly over the span of a few years. </font></p>
