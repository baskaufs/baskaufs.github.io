<p>Walter was &quot;in his 13th year when his parents, <a href="2.htm">Uriah and 
Betsey (Doud) Edgecomb</a>, settled in Bath Township [Allen Co., OH]. He 
received a limited education in the district schools of his time, and when 18 
years of age started life for himself, working on a farm by the day and month 
until he was 21.&quot;<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> </p>

<p>On 13 Nov 1840, Walter married Laura Bassitt<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>, 
daughter of <a href="3.htm">Samuel and Elsie (Lewis) Bassitt.</a> &quot;After his 
marriage, our subject engaged in farming on a rented farm. He has owned two 
farms besides the one he now occupies&quot;<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> (in 1885). 
One of these farms was 60 acres in the southwest quarter of section 24 in Monroe 
Township (then in Putnam Co.) which he bought on 17 Jul 1838<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>. 
This land was about two miles north of land purchased by his brothers 
<a href="d.htm">Lansil</a> and 
<a href="b.htm">Ezra</a> a few years earlier. However, it does not appear that Walter and Laura 
lived there, since they were listed as &quot;of Allen Co.&quot; when they sold it in 1842<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>. 
It is likely that they were living near where his father moved in section 11 in 
1845. The 1850 census lists Walter's household after his father <a href="2.htm">Uriah</a> and his 
sister <a href="g.htm">Clarinda Snyder</a> and before Elias Everett who lived at 
the corner of Bluelick Rd. and the Dixie Hwy. This would also locate their 
family less than a mile from Laura's parents' farm. Walter also bought a 40 acre 
farm in section 12 in 1849, but this is probably not where he lived. </p>
<p>In December 1856, Walter and Laura moved to the farm in section 1 (near the 
corner of Sugar Creek Rd. and the Dixie Hwy.) where they spent the rest of their 
lives<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>, &quot;all of which he has cleared and improved.&quot;<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>

Lewis Alfred Edgecomb</p>
<p>As the Civil War raged through the southern states in the early 1860's, many 
families in the area felt its effect as their sons left home to join the 
regiments. On 13 May 1864, Walter Edgecomb's son, Alfred, wrote home to his
<a href="3.htm">Grandfather Bassett</a> describing his experiences with the 12th 
Ohio Volunteer Infantry in Alabama: </p>
<dl>
  <dd>Now Grand Pap and Grandmother, I will talk to you with the pen a little 
  while as we cannot talk face to face, and will tell you that I am all over 
  well and like to soldier Bully well and I hope these few lines may find you 
  two well although your heads is ablossoming with Grey hairs. I trust that I 
  and You will live to see Each other on Earth and talk face to face and then I 
  can have the Pleasure of atelling you some good storys. I tell You there is 
  plenty of cesesh [secessionist] families around here but thank the Lord they 
  have not much to be saucy over. They have nothing in the shape of Chickens, 
  pigs, geese, or anything that can be eat and the soldiers can eat anything 
  now. </dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dd>There is not but two men sick in the Regt. There has not a man died since 
  I came out in the Regiment. When we was at Clifton there was Eight privates 
  and one Lieutenant and I was among the squad went out on a Scout and we only 
  saw two Rebbels and we captured both of them and the next morning he under 
  took to get away and as he was apassing the Picket line they saw him and 
  Halted him three times and he no halt and the picket shot him dead and we 
  fetched the other one down here with us and last night he undertook to get out 
  of the guard house and he was in the upper story and he jumped out of the 
  window and broke one leg and one of his arms and I tell You he did not get 
  far. I expect he will be shot as a spy for his papers show that he is a Rebbel 
  spy of the worst kind. </dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dd>Old forest has got out of this neck of woods I guess and it is well for 
  his old Jacket that he did for if we had of a got ahold of him we would of 
  apunched his hide so full of holes that it would not hold Water, for we have 
  about 8 or 9 thousand men here and plenty of Artillery. I tell you there is 
  plenty of News to read here now and we have nothing to do but to read it. I 
  suppose you have heard about the fight at Richmond. General Breckenritz and 
  Beaureguard say that they can do nothing and they might just as well give up 
  the job and so think I. I think that we will get to come home to stay against 
  one year from this time. There is a Jolly old set of boys here now I tell you. 
  There is all kinds of tearing around all the time. We are Camped in a pretty 
  place. It is a nice Country through here as I ever saw. There is plenty of 
  fine trees to shade us. </dd>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dd>I must bring my few lines to a close for the Major and Colonel has got 
  their horses saddled. If you cant Read this fetch it down here to me and I 
  will read it for you. Write soon without Delay. From Lewis A. Edgecomb<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>But Alfred's wish to tell his grandparents some good stories face to face was 
not to be granted. Two months later he was killed in Atlanta, Georgia. </p>
<p>Walter Edgecomb &quot;has been a farmer all his life, and by industry and close 
attention to business has acquired a competency. He served as township trustee a 
number of years, and is much respected by his neighbors.&quot;<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> 
&quot;Our subject is one of the leading farmers of Bath. In politics he is a 
Republican. Mr. and Mrs. Edgecomb are members of the Disciples Church.&quot;<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> 
According to his daughter Loretta Barber, Walter said that he would not live in 
a community where there was not a church and a school for his children to 
attend.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> </p>
<p>Walter died on 16 Jun 1893 and Laura died on 28 Feb 1904. They were buried 
together in the <a href="bes-tour.htm#beaverdam">old Beaverdam cemetery</a>.<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup></p>
