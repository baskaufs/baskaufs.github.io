<p>Uriah (b. 1781) was married to Elizabeth &quot;Betsey&quot; Doud (born 1792<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> and 11 years 
his junior) in Connecticut sometime c. 1808 to 1810.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> At this time, the Doud and 
Edgecomb families began the move to the western frontier. Uriah Edgecomb is listed in the 1810 
census for Canton, Connecticut<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> with a female the appropriate age to be Betsy and 
one child under 10 (presumably their eldest son, Uriah). We 
find Uriah selling land in Canton, Conn. in March of 1811<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> , and purchasing land 
in August in Preston, Chenango County, New York the same year<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>. This land was described as &quot;part of lot 
number 42 to 43 in Township number fourteen&quot;. </p>

<p>Apparently Uriah and Betsey made 
the move to New York with her brother <a href="5.htm">Alvah Doud</a>.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup> Alvah is also listed in the 
1810 census there and Uriah and Alvah sold land together in Preston in 1815. 
<a href="5.htm">Betsey's parents and their family</a> also made the move west to New York. They were 
not alone, as many other Connecticut residents were also moving west during this 
time. &quot;The pressure of the rapidly growing population in [Connecticut] meant 
that many families were being driven to cultivation of thin marginal lands, 
which under then current agricultural practices could not produce crops adequate 
for a decent standard of living. ... It is little wonder that the availability 
of far cheaper and more fertile lands on the frontier caused an explosive 
emigration movement by thousands of Connecticut Yankees.&quot;<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> Uriah and Betsey lived 
in New York until about 1818. Uriah and Betsey signed a deed together when they 
sold land there.<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup> </p>

<b>Sumner-Savory Map of the Connecticut Western Reserve and Fire Lands - 1826 
(Cleveland Public Library)</b>&nbsp;

<p><i>Movement to the Western Reserve in Ohio </i></p>
<p>Following the end of the War of 1812, many settlers from Connecticut were hit 
by &quot;Ohio Fever&quot; and moved to the northeast corner of Ohio. This area, called the 
Connecticut Western Reserve, was an artifact of the early colonial period when 
most of the original colonies claimed land from their eastern borders west to 
the Pacific Ocean, even though they had no idea what lay beyond the Appalachian 
mountains. This caused some problems after the formation of the United States, 
since some states (such as Connecticut and Pennsylvania) claimed the same areas. 
When Connecticut ceded her claims to land in Pennsylvania, she specifically 
reserved a strip of land in the Northwest Territories (now Ohio), the &quot;Western 
Reserve&quot;. This land was not unoccupied - it was the home to many Native 
Americans and it was not until after these people had been coerced into moving 
further west in 1805 that settlers began to migrate there in large numbers.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> 
In 1820, we find Uriah and Betsey living in Paris Township of Portage County, 
Ohio with their six children.<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There appears to have been an extensive migration of families from Chenango 
and Cortland Counties in New York to southwest corner of Trumbull County (which 
borders Paris Township) soon after this time. <a href="5.htm">Alvah Doud</a>, Betsey's brother, came 
about the same time as she and Uriah did. They were followed by her parents and 
three sisters, several of her aunts and uncles, and Uriah's brother 
<a href="q.htm">John</a> (who 
applied for a pension there in 1831). Other families which would later be 
closely associated with the Edgecombs in Allen County, Ohio also moved from New 
York to Trumbull County at this time, namely the <a href="7.htm">Lewis's</a>, <a href="1.htm">
Snyders</a>, <a href="3.htm">Bassetts</a>, Everetts, and perhaps the Olmsteads. 
In 1830, Uriah lived in Braceville Township with his family which had now grown 
to 9 children. By this time, the oldest son, Uriah (III), was either living on 
his own or had died, since the census does not place him at his parents' home. 
<a href="b.htm"> Ezra</a> may have also been on his own by that time.<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup> 
It has been suggested that Uriah and Betsy were living with or near Betsey's 
brother Alva or her parents.<sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>The Edgecombs in Allen County, Ohio </i></p>
<p>We don't know why the urge to move on was so strong - whether the soil in 
northeast Ohio was too poor or if Uriah just had itchy feet, but by 1832 the 
family was ready to move on again to Allen County in Northwestern Ohio. We also 
don't know why they chose to go there in particular, since Uriah and his family 
seem to have been the first of many Trumbull County folks to go there. In any 
case, Allen County was a wilderness at the time they moved. </p>
<p>Although much of the rest of Ohio had been settled by whites much earlier, 
the northwest quarter of the state had been set aside in the Treaty of 
Greenville of 1795 as a &quot;permanent&quot; reserve for the Indians. It was not until 
1817, when the white population of Ohio became overcome with greed for this 
Indian land, that they pushed the Indians onto three small reservations of 
twenty-five, ten, and forty square miles respectively in the Treaties of Maumee 
and St. Mary's. Although this act theoretically opened up the area to settlers, 
the settlement actually proceeded rather slowly. One reason for this was that 
much of the area around Allen County consisted of two great wetlands: the Great 
Black Swamp and the Hog Creek and Sciota Marshes. The soggy soil made farming 
impossible in many places and malaria (known at that time as &quot;ague&quot; and which 
was thought at the time to be caused by the vapors of the marsh) made life 
difficult there. The first white settlers in Allen County came in 1824 and 
started the Sugar Creek settlement in Bath Township on higher ground between the 
two swamps. To give an idea of how dense the wilderness was at that time, a 
second family lived at the Hog Creek settlement within a few miles of the Sugar 
Creek settlement for a year before the two parties became aware of each other's 
existence! </p>
<p>Uriah's oldest daughter, <a href="c.htm">Marilla was married to Josiah DeLong</a> in about 1832. 
It is not known whether they were married before or after the family moved to 
Allen County. <a href="d.htm"> Lansil</a>, who did move with the family apparently returned briefly 
in 1837 to Trumbull County for his marriage. The family's trip to 
Allen County must have been difficult, since roads were non-existent and the 
family was large, ranging from <a href="b.htm"> Ezra</a><b> </b>who was twenty, to the infant girls.
<a href="f.htm">Walter Edgecomb</a>, who was about thirteen at the time, 
describes the family's journey from Trumbull County thus: &quot;He states they were 
twenty-one days making the trip, bringing their stock with them. When they 
arrived Indians were still in the neighborhood, and he remembers seeing them 
frequently passing through the woods in single file.&quot;<sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup></p>
<p>On 12 Jul 1832, Uriah bought eighty acres of land located near the banks of 
the Sugar Creek in Bath Township<sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup>. This land was 
an original grant from the State of Ohio and was a part of several tracts of 
land given by the federal government to the State of Ohio. The proceeds from the 
sale of the land were intended to be used to finance the building of the 
Miami-Erie Canal, which passed through the western part of Allen County and was 
a major factor in the development of the area after it opened in 1844. On those 
80 acres the family made their home. An Indian cemetery was located in the 
northwest corner of their farm and this may explain why they frequently saw the 
Shawnee Indians passing by on their way from the nearby Hog Creek reservation 
(now Shawnee Township). </p>
<p>But the Indians were not to remain for long. Despite promises that the 
reservations were theirs forever, they were persuaded to sell them and relocate 
to Kansas. In the fall of 1832, &quot;many surrendered themselves to despair, and 
plunged into a course of dissipation; others, with more regard to the legends of 
the tribe, collected their trophies, articles of the chase, domestic utensils, 
and even leveled the mounds of the burial grounds of the tribe. This 
accomplished, the sub-agents, Robb and Workman, gave the order to proceed on 
that long Western journey, and 700 members of the Shawnee family, with half that 
number of Senecas, moved toward the west...&quot;.<sup><a href="#23">23</a></sup> 
Their wooded hunting grounds and sacred burial grounds were transformed into 
corn fields and their memory would only be evoked when some later resident 
plowed up one of their relics years later. </p>
<p>In about 1834, Betsey's sister <a href="5.htm">Chloe</a> and her husband, George Olmstead 
followed the Edgecombs from Trumbull County to Allen County.<sup><a href="#24">24</a></sup> 
This was the beginning of a tide of Trumbull County folks who were among the 
first white settlers of the northwest corner of Bath Township. Included in this 
group was Uriah's nephew, <a href="p.htm">Phineas Spencer Edgecomb</a> (b. 5 Sep 1795, son of 
Uriah's brother,  
<a href="q.htm">John</a>) who lived out the rest of his life there. Uriah's older 
sons, <a href="b.htm"> Ezra</a> and <a href="d.htm"> Lansil</a>, bought land near his farm in 1833, and <a href="e.htm"> Robert</a><b> </b>did the 
same in 1835. The children of Uriah and Betsey began families of their own. For 
supplies and news, the families traveled to the log cabin village of Lima (now a 
city of 40 000), founded only a few years earlier in 1831. On 4 Apr 1835, Uriah 
and Elizabeth Edgecomb took out a mortgage on their farm for $250 with the Ohio 
Life Insurance and Trust Co.<sup><a href="#25">25</a></sup> In the record of 
this transaction, Elizabeth signed with &quot;her X mark&quot;, indicating that she was 
illiterate. </p>
<p>Tragedy struck the Edgecomb family when Betsey died on 11 Jan 1838. She was 
laid to rest in a <a href="bes-tour.htm#sproat">small cemetery</a> on a hilltop just north of their farm on what 
is now Wolfe Road. Other family members were later buried there, including Uriah, 
<a href="b.htm"> Ezra</a>, Amy, and <a href="p.htm">Phineas</a>. The weathered tombstones of these and other Trumbull 
County emigrants can still be seen there today. Another cemetery in the nearby 
village of Beaverdam contains the graves of <a href="f.htm">Walter</a>,  <a href="i.htm">
Marquis</a>, and <a href="l.htm">Sarah</a>, as well 
as Betsey Edgecomb's sister <a href="5.htm">Chloe (Olmstead) Mowen</a>. </p>
<p>Several of Uriah's children married children from the other Trumbull County 
families that followed the Edgecombs to Allen County. One such family was
<a href="3.htm">Samuel and Elsie (Lewis) Bassett</a>, who came to Bath Township 
in 1836. <a href="f.htm">Walter married Laura</a>, the oldest Bassett girl, and
<a href="l.htm">Sarah married Lewis Bassett</a>. In addition to Walter and 
Sarah, Ezra, <a href="g.htm">Clarinda</a>,  <a href="i.htm">Marquis</a>, and Amy lived out most of 
their lives around an area called &quot;<a href="bes-tour.htm#lordstown">Lordstown</a>&quot; (after a township in Trumbull 
County) in the northwest corner of Bath Township and around the nearby village 
of Beaverdam. The Edgecomb family maintained connections with their relatives in 
Trumbull County and were visited by <a href="5.htm">Doud</a> cousins from there. <sup><a href="#26">
26</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1845, Uriah bought the southeast quarter of section 11 (shown as the Hiram 
Prottsman farm on the 1880 map)<sup><a href="#27">27</a></sup>. He lived there 
with his youngest son <a href="i.htm">Marquis</a><sup><a href="#28">28</a></sup> until 1857, when 
they moved just west of Beaverdam<sup><a href="#29">29</a></sup>. Both Uriah and 
 
<a href="i.htm">Marquis</a> bought land there in the late 1850's. In the 1860 census, Uriah was 
listed living by himself in Richland Twp. in a separate household from  <a href="i.htm">
Marquis</a>.<sup><a href="#30">30</a></sup> 
Uriah died on 22 Jul 1861<sup><a href="#31">31</a></sup>, at  <a href="i.htm">
Marquis</a>' home. </p>
