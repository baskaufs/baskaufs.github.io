<p>Sarah Edgecomb, daughter of <a href="2.htm">Uriah and Betsey Edgecomb</a>, 
and Lewis Bassitt, son of <a href="3.htm">Samuel and Elsie (Lewis) Bassitt</a>, 
were married on 29 Dec 1847.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> Their families were 
well acquainted - in fact Lewis' oldest sister <a href="f.htm">Laura</a> had 
married Sarah's older brother <a href="f.htm">Walter</a> seven years earlier. On 
April 4th of the following year, Lewis paid $107.20 to buy forty acres of land 
in section 12 of Bath Township from the State of Ohio. (This land had been 
granted by an act of congress to the state to aid in financing the construction 
of the Miami and Erie Canal. The canal, which connected Lake Erie with the Ohio 
River, was completed in 1845 and ran through the western edge of Allen County.) 
Lewis and Sarah settled down on this land, which is located northeast of the 
intersection of present-day Bluelick and Thayer Roads, and which adjoined the 
farm of Lewis' parents to the south. </p>
<p>Sarah and Lewis began rearing a large family, which eventually grew to eleven 
children: </p>

<p>From their early days, the boys had to work hard helping their dad with the 
farm work. And he certainly needed help with more and more little mouths to 
feed. Sarah must have been very busy, since for years there were no girls in the 
family to help her. The family also took an interest in spiritual matters, as 
evidenced by their support of the American Bible Society in 1863.<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1864, there were distractions for teenage boys as the Civil War raged and 
the local newspapers whipped up sentiments with calls for patriotic young men to 
enlist. The promise of adventure, lure of $300 bounty money, and the example of 
several cousins enticed Sam to persuade his parents to let him enlist at the age 
of only fifteen. On February 12, he was mustered into company I of the 27th Ohio 
Volunteer Infantry and left six days later for an experience that would change 
his life forever. His exploits are chronicled in a <a href="civil-war/about.htm">series of letters</a> that he 
wrote home which were carefully saved by his parents<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup> 
and can still be seen at the Allen County Museum in Lima. In these letters, one 
can trace changes in his outlook as he moved with his unit through the South:

<p>Samuel did come back to Ohio after the war, and the family was reunited 
again. Sometime in the 1870's, Lewis built a large house for his family on the 
farm. <a href="bes-tour.htm#bassett-homestead">The house on the east side of Thayer Rd.</a> just north of Bluelick Rd. is 
still standing there today and has been occupied by generations of the family 
through Lewis' great-great-great grandsons. </p>
<p>Philo followed in his father Lewis' footsteps on the farm. As a young man, he 
and his second cousin, <a href="p.htm">Franklin P. Edgecomb</a> worked splitting rails for fences 
from timber cut in the forests of Bath Township. &quot;When we were boys, Philo 
Bassett and I had never made rails, but we wanted to try. We made 4000 for my 
father, 5000 for Lew Bassett (Philo's father) and 17 000 for Almon Hadsell. By 
that time we felt as if we knew how to make rails!&quot;<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup> 
Frank Edgecomb also recalled an experience he had once with Lewis: </p>
<dl>
  <dd>I recall when the Erie Railroad came through Allen County. Old man Bassett 
  took $100 worth of stock; was later offered $20 for it but did not sell, 
  holding on to it for years. Lew Bassett and I decided to go to the State Fair, 
  but he refused to buy a ticket. The train was crowded and when the conductor 
  came along to collect the fares, he took my ticket and asked old man Bassett 
  for his. Lew showed him his stock in the railroad, to which the conductor 
  stated, &quot;Old man, you can't ride on that.&quot; &quot;Keep it&quot;, says Mr. Bassett. &quot;You 
  pay or I'll put you off&quot;, replied the conductor. &quot;It takes a man to do that&quot;, 
  was Mr. Bassett's reply. &quot;I'll show you&quot;, says the conductor. &quot;At the next 
  station you get off.&quot; This Mr. Bassett did not do. So I told the conductor I 
  would pay the fare for Mr. Bassett. So then Mr. Bassett was telling me that he 
  was getting to ride for his railroad stock, so I finally told him that I had 
  paid for him. On the way home Mr. Bassett paid his own fare.<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>In about 1890, all of the children who lived into adulthood got together for 
a family photograph. Unfortunately, on that day Philo (who had quite a temper) 
was mad about something and refused to go and have his picture taken with the 
rest. Soon afterward, Sarah died on 1891 January 28, probably of cancer. A large 
portrait of Sarah was made from that family photograph; perhaps it was 
commissioned by her grieving husband. </p>
<p>In his old age, Lewis would often drive a horse and buggy up to Beaverdam to 
visit his grandchildren (Samuel's children) there. DeWitt Bassett remembered 
that as a child he used to talk to him during those visits. He was a &quot;nice old 
fellow&quot;, and no longer had the beard that he had during his earlier years.<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup> 
In 1899, Lewis received a letter from his son Samuel, who at that time was 
working in the Treasury Dept. in Washington, DC. The letter gives a feeling of 
how their lives had diverged since Samuel left Ohio: &quot; … I want you to answer 
this Father and tell me all the news. How your crops are, and how you are all 
getting along. How is the oil excitement, and have they found oil on your farm 
yet? How is the wheat and corn, and hay and hogs. It has been so long since I 
have been in a wheat field, or had any thing to do with any such things, that I 
am getting rather homesick to be with them again and see whether it would seem 
natural. I am shut up here in the office from 9 in the morning until 4 in the 
afternoon without even the sun shining on me …&quot; <i><font size="2">
<a href="civil-war/shb-99-07-22.htm">[read full letter]</a></font></i></p>
<p>Lewis died on 25 March 1902 and was buried next to Sarah in the old cemetery 
on the east side of Beaverdam. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/notes/049.gif" width="531" height="584"></p>
<p><b><a name="spelling"></a>How do you spell Basse/itt? </b></p>
<p>According to Frank G. Lewis, a genealogist working on Bassett genealogy in 
1919, the spelling Bassitt is unique to the Allen County, Ohio Bassetts.<sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup> All other Bassetts around the country spell the name 
Bassett. </p>
<p>This can be understood when realizes that <a href="3.htm">Samuel and Elsa 
Bassitt</a>, parents of Lewis, who came to Allen County when their children were 
quite young, could not write their names. In deeds from New York to Ohio, they 
signed by an &quot;X&quot;. For example: </p>
<p>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="images/notes/254-signature.gif" width="864" height="364"></p>
<p>Since there were few other Bassetts in the area, people simply spelled the 
name the way it sounded: Bassitt, Bassit, Basset, etc. </p>
<p>Samuel and Elsie had only one son, Lewis, and he and all of his family signed 
their name Bassitt into the 20th century. When Samuel and Elsa died, both of 
their tombstones were inscribed Bassitt. Although Bassitt seems to have been the 
accepted spelling, the spelling didn't seem to be an issue until about 1920 . 
Lewis and Sarah, who died in 1902 and 1891 respectively, share one tombstone, 
yet on one side it says Lewis Bassitt and on the other side Sarah Bassett. </p>
<p>The &quot;correctness&quot; of the spelling of the name seems to have only become an 
issue with the grandchildren of Lewis and successive generations. Of the four 
sons of Lewis which had descendants bearing the family name, descendants of 
Samuel H. and Philo use Bassett, and those of Marquis and William<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup> 
use Bassitt. </p>
<p>The greatest amount of &quot;argument&quot; (all in fun, of course) about the issue of 
spelling seems to be between descendants of Philo and Marquis. Perhaps this is 
because those two seem to have been the most stubborn of Lewis' sons! In defense 
of the -ett clan, everybody else does spell it that way. However the -itt branch 
claims that that is only because the -ett Bassetts are too lazy to dot the i. 
Only time will tell if the conflict will ever be resolved!</p>

<p><font size="2"><a name="21"></a>21. The name &quot;Rozetta&quot; has always been 
somewhat of a mystery since it is a somewhat unusual name and there were no 
known relatives who also had this name.&nbsp; However, it now seems probably 
that Elsie (Lewis) Bassitt (mother of Lewis Bassitt) was a sister of Betsy 
(Lewis) Snyder. It also now seems likely based on circumstantial evidence that
<a href="s1.htm">Peter and Betsy Snyder</a> had a daughter Rosetta (Snyder) 
Richardson.&nbsp; If these suppositions are true, then Lewis Bassett and Rosetta 
Richardson would be first cousins.&nbsp; Lewis was a baby when his family moved to 
Trumbull County from New York in about 1826.&nbsp; Mary Rosetta would have been about 
10 years older than him and if her family moved to Trumbull County at the same 
time as the Bassetts (as I believe they did) and were neighbors (as I think they 
were), she might have been his older playmate or perhaps baby sitter for the 
first several years of Lewis' life.&nbsp; That may have inspired him to name his 
first daughter after her.&nbsp; </font></p>
