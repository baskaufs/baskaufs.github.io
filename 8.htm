<p>John Edgecomb, our earliest proven Edgecomb ancestor, first appears in the 
records of West Hartford, Connecticut on 19 May 1729 when he &quot;owned the 
covenant&quot; at the West Hartford Church. On the same day, a Phebe Brace joined the 
same church. It is possible that she was the Phebe who later became the wife of 
John. </p>
<p>On 26 Sep 1735, a survey was recorded for land in New Hartford granted to 
John by the proprietors of the town. Other land transactions involving John Edgecomb were recorded in New Hartford and Simsbury from 1735 to 1764. In March 
of 1738 a deed recorded that John purchased land in Barkhamstead with Henry 
Brace, Jr., sister of Phebe. This additional circumstantial evidence supports 
the idea that John's wife Phebe may have been Phebe Brace. </p>
<p>The town records of 
New Hartford record the births of John and Phebe Edgecomb's children<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>: </p>
<dl>
  <dt><b>John</b> b. 16 Mar 1738/9 d. before 1 May 1775 </dt>
  <dt><b><a href="4.htm">Uriah</a></b> 24 March 1740/1 - Jan 1810 
</dt>
  <dt><b>Ammi (Humphrey)</b> b. 20 Feb 1745/6 m. Jonathan Humphrey </dt>
  <dt><b>Ezra</b> b. 3 May 1748 m. 
Elizabeth UNKNOWN </dt>
  <dt><b>Huldah &quot;Huldy&quot; (Mills)</b> b. 28 Jun 1749 m. David Mills </dt>
</dl>
<p>In 1756, John entered the Connecticut militia to serve in the French and 
Indian War. By 1758 when he left the militia, he had attained the rank of 
Lieutenant.  </p>
<p>John died sometime in or before 1772. In the records of his estate, 
he is referred to as &quot;Lieut. John Edgecomb&quot;. His son John was not mentioned and 
was therefore probably deceased before that time. Lieut. John's son Uriah was 
administrator of his father's estate and was described as his &quot;eldest son&quot;. On 
18 Apr 1772, an allowance from his estate was given to &quot;Mrs. Phebe Edgecomb, 
widow of said John deceased&quot;. On 7 Dec 1772, the New Hartford church records 
report that &quot;Phebe Edgecomb, widow&quot; was assigned to Pettibone's district.  </p>
<p>A 
number of genealogists have sought to connect Lieut. John with the Edgecombs of 
New London, Connecticut and hence to many generations of Edgecombs in England<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. 
Despite much time and research, the effort to definitively make a connection has 
not been successful.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> A John Edgecomb, b. 29 Jan 1700/1 and son of John and 
Hannah (Hempstead) Edgecomb is the most likely candidate to be Lieut. John 
Edgecomb. However, if this were Lieut. John, this birth date would have made him 
much older than the typical age at the birth of his first child. The will of 
John Edgecomb (m. Hannah) also insinuates that his son John (b. 1700/1) was 
deceased by 1736. Until further evidence is found, the question of Lieut. John's 
ancestry must remain unanswered.</p>
