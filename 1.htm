<p>Philip &quot;was a blacksmith and and expert at his trade, which he followed all 
his active life.&quot;<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a> <a href="#census1810">In 
1810</a>, Philip and Mary lived in Gallatin, Columbia Co., NY.&nbsp; In 1815, 
Philip moved to &quot;Ball Hill&quot; in the Town of Candice, Ontario Co., NY.<sup><a href="#5">5</a>
<a href="#6">6</a></sup>&nbsp; &quot;Ball Hill&quot; is described as follows: &quot;Canadice 
lies on the northern declivities of the central Allegheny Mountain Range, 
separated by Canadice Lake into two distinct ranges running in a northerly and 
southerly direction. The west ridge is sometimes written as Bald Hill from the 
impression it presented to early pioneers, being covered only with small trees 
and shrubs, burned and stinted by the frequent fires of the Senecas. It was also 
referred to as Ball Hill from the shape, being a very well formed segment of a 
circle perhaps twelve or fifteen miles in diameter. …&quot;.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup></p>

<p>According to the histories, Philip came with Benjamin and Peter Snyder, 
although it is not known what their exact relationship was to Philip.&nbsp; It 
has been hypothesized that they were brothers and that Peter was the
<a href="s1.htm">Peter Snyder b. c.1793</a> (however there is also some evidence 
to contract this).&nbsp; <a href="#census1820">In 1820</a>, Philip Snyder is 
living with his family in the Town of Richmond, Ontario County, which is 
adjacent to Candice (see <a href="images/notes/ontario-map.jpg">map made by 
Wilbur Everett</a>).&nbsp; Philip and Mary's son Peter stated that he was born 
in Livingston County in 1820.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>&nbsp; However, this 
is not a major contradiction with the census data since Livingston County was 
formed from Ontario and Genesee Counties in 1821 and present-day Livingston Co., 
lies immediately west of Richmond and Candice.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The <a href="pages/calvin-snyder-memories.htm">recollections of Calvin Snyder</a> 
(b. 1874, son of Jasper Snyder 1854-1926 and grandson of Peter Snyder, b.1820) provide 
some interesting stories that may be related to the early history of this 
family.&nbsp; There are several items that are attributed to Peter Snyder, but 
that are more likely to have occurred in Philip Snyder's generation.&nbsp; One 
is a description of &quot;a Dutchman from Pennsylvania ... [who] walked all the way 
from Pennsylvania... . [His] sole possessions consisted of the clothes he wore 
and an ax. Here he met a young red-haird German girl ..., who could not speak 
English.&quot;&nbsp; Could this be Philip Snyder and Mary Sharpsteen?</p>

<p>Another <a href="pages/calvin-snyder-memories.htm">story told by Calvin 
Snyder</a> involves &quot;another boy (I can't remember his name) who was stolen by 
the Indians and was tortured and killed. Grandfather wanted to bring his body 
back home. Someway he learned where the body was, took a team and wagon and went 
after him. To protect and conceal the body he had a load of turnips. He found 
the boy's body, put it in the bottom of the wagon, covered it with turnips and 
brought it safely home for burial.&quot;&nbsp; The &quot;Grandfather&quot; could not have been 
Peter Snyder, who was too young to have had encounters with Indians.&nbsp; 
However, it is possible that the story might have involved Philip Snyder and one 
of his oldest children in New York.&nbsp; There were Indians in New York when 
they lived there.</p>

<p>Philip, Jr. died in about 1824<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.&nbsp; It appears that 
most of his family remained in New York until at least after 1840.&nbsp; The 
exceptions to this were Lorenzo and Peter, who moved to Trumbull Co., Ohio in 
about 1832 or 1833. Peter lived with Lorenzo for about year and afterwards 
worked by the month doing farm work during five months in the summer and 
attended school in the winter<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> while <a href="s.htm">
Lorenzo and his wife Julia Ann</a> apparently moved back to New York.&nbsp; In 1835, Lorenzo and his 
wife Julia Ann bought the southwest quarter of section 14 in Bath Township, Allen 
Co., Ohio. This is in the northwest part of the township where many other 
immigrants from northeastern Ohio settled, including the <a href="3.htm">Bassitts</a> and 
<a href="2.htm">Edgecombs</a>. 
It is not known whether Lorenzo and Julia Ann were still living in Trumbull Co. at 
that time or if the had already moved to Allen County, but by Sep 1838, when 
they sold the north half of this land, they were described as &quot;of Allen County, 
Ohio&quot;<a href="#8"><sup>8</sup></a>. In about 1839 Peter moved to Bath Twp. and became acquainted with the 
family of <a href="2.htm">Uriah and Betsy Edgecomb</a> (who had come from Trumbull County in 1832). 
The next year on April 9th, Peter was married to their daughter Clarinda. Unlike 
the rest of Peter's family, <a href="g.htm">he and Clarinda remained in Allen County, Ohio</a> for 
the rest of their lives<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>.&nbsp; In 1840, Cornelius 
was also living in Richland Twp., Allen Co., OH (see below), but by 1840, Lorenzo and 
Julia Ann had already moved back to New York and were living in Hinsdale, 
Cattaraugus Co., NY.<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>&nbsp; Other family members moved to Cattaraugus 
Co. as well, perhaps when family land in Ontario County was sold in 1838.&nbsp; </p>

<p>There seems to have been a mass exodus of the family to Michigan in the 
1840's.&nbsp; Between 1845 and 1847 Lorenzo moved to Calhoun Co., Michigan.&nbsp; 
Other siblings including John, Henry, Cornelius, Mary, Walter, Louisa, 
Philip (III), and Phebe eventually ended up in Michigan as well<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>.&nbsp; 
</p>

<p><b>Henry</b> is listed next to his grandfather John Sharpsteen in the 1830 census 
for Leicester, Ontario Co., NY.<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup>&nbsp; He is still 
listed in Leicester (now Livingston Co.) NY in 1840.<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup> 
In the 1850 census, he is shown to have moved with others of his siblings west 
to Hinsdale, Cattaraugus Co., NY.&nbsp; At that point his wife has apparently 
died and he is listed in the household of Perry M. Ramsey, who may be his 
son-in-law.<sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup></p>

<p>A possible <b>John</b> might be John B. Snider listed in the 1850 census for 
Clarence, Calhoun Co., MI.<sup><a href="census/1850-mi-calhoun-clarence-187.jpg">37</a></sup>&nbsp; 
He was aged 43 and married to Elizabeth (aged 44).&nbsp; He also shows up in the 
1860 census for Clarence.<sup><a href="#38">38</a></sup>&nbsp; </p>

<p>It is not known whether <b>William</b> lived in Michigan, but he was said by Peter to be living in Iowa in 1896<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>.&nbsp; 
The 1880 census<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup> shows William Snyder (aged 68) 
and wife Rachel E. (aged 60) living in State Center, Marshall Co., Iowa.&nbsp; 
William and both of his parents were listed as born in New York.&nbsp; It is 
extremely likely that this is the William son of Philip Snyder, Jr.&nbsp; Thus 
his birth date would be about 1812.</p>

<p>Since <b>Walter</b> is a relatively common name, it is more difficult to 
ensure that we have identified the correct one.&nbsp; However, there is a Walter 
Snyder, married to Lucinda, who fits well with the requirements for the Walter 
son of Philip Snyder, Jr.&nbsp; In 1850, he was listed in Pontiac, Oakland Co., 
MI as a miller aged 33 and born in New York with wife Lucinda, aged 36 and also 
born in NY.<sup><a href="#30">30</a></sup>&nbsp; His children Julia (8) and 
George (6) were listed as born in New York and Volney (a male, 4) and Mary (2) 
were listed as born in Michigan.&nbsp; That would indicate that they moved from 
New York to Michigan in about 1845, which is about the time other siblings moved 
from New York to Michigan.&nbsp; It is also noteworthy that Julia was the name 
of Walter's sister-in-law and George and Mary were also names in the family.&nbsp; 
In 1860, the family was listed in Barry, Barry Co., MI with children listed as: 
Geo. M (16), Valney C (14), Mary E (12), Lucinda (10), Margarett H (7), and 
David S (5) with George born in New York and the rest born in Michigan.&nbsp; It 
should be noted that Barry Co., MI was also where Louisa Learn, Walter's sister 
also lived.&nbsp; In 1870, Walter and Lucinda are still living in Barry with 
Margaret (17) and Daniel (aged 15 and not David as listed in the earlier 
census).<sup><a href="#32">32</a></sup>&nbsp; In 1880, Walter S. Snyder (63) and 
Lucinda B Snyder (65) are listed for Barry.&nbsp; They are still living with 
Margarett H (27, a school teacher) and Daniel S (25).<sup><a href="#33">33</a></sup>&nbsp; 
The listing also shows both of Walter's parents to have been born in New York, 
which is consistent with Philip and Mary Snyder as his parents.</p>

<p><b>Cornelius</b> was said by Peter to have died in Michigan before 1896.<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp; 
There were few Cornelius Snyder or Sniders and one who was listed in the 1870 
census in White Rock, Huron Co., Michigan<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup> was 
aged 58 and born in New York.&nbsp; It is noteworthy that one of the children 
listed in the household was named Lorenzo.&nbsp; Given the relative uncommonness 
of that name, this suggests strongly that this Cornelius was a brother of 
Lorenzo. The birthplaces of the children suggest that the family was living in 
Ohio in 1850.&nbsp; A search of the 1850 census for Ohio turns up the same 
Cornelius living in Perry Township, Allen County, OH.<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup>&nbsp; 
This is near where Peter Snyder (b. 1820) was living at the time, again strongly 
suggesting that this Cornelius was one of the children of Philip Snyder, Jr.&nbsp; 
Other circumstantial evidence: child named Henry (name of brother and middle 
name of grandfather), child named Mary (mother), and proximity in 1850 to
<a href="census/1850-oh-allen-perry-298.jpg">Lansil Edgecomb</a>, an older 
brother of Peter's wife Clarinda.&nbsp; There are also two Cornelius Snyders 
(aged 20-30 with wives aged 20-30 and single males under age 5) that are listed 
in the 1840 census for Putnam County (one in Blanchard Twp.<sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup> 
and the other in Richland Twp.<sup><a href="#22">22</a>).</sup>&nbsp; Richland 
Township touches Bath Township at the corner near where Peter and Lorenzo were 
living in 1840, so it is likely that Cornelius (son of Philip Snyder, Jr.) was 
living there in 1840.&nbsp; This is supported by the birthplace of his son, 
Asbery, who was listed as born in Ohio in 1839.<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup>&nbsp; The 1870 census age suggests a birthdate 
for Cornelius 
of c.1812 and the 1850 census suggest c.1810.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>Mary</b> Slocum and her husband Asa lived in Andover, Allegany Co., NY in 
1850<sup><a href="#23">23</a></sup> with children Henry (b. c.1838), Esther (b. 
c.1839), Susan (b. c.1843) and Zachary (or Zacoriah b. c.1849).&nbsp; They were 
still living there in 1860<sup><a href="#24">24</a></sup> with an additional 
child Jane (b. c.1855).&nbsp; By 1870, Asa and Mary had moved to Williamston in 
Ingham Co., Michigan.<sup><a href="#25">25</a></sup>&nbsp; Zachary and Jane were 
listed in the same household and a William Slocum (aged 29) was listed next 
door.&nbsp; In 1880<sup><a href="#26">26</a></sup>, Asa is listed without Mary 
and with a grandson William in his household and living next to Zackery and his 
family with brother Henry.&nbsp; Presumably Mary died between 1870 and 1880.&nbsp; </p>

<p>As was the case with Walter, <b>Philip</b> is a common name, so there is 
reduced confidence that we have the correct one as Philip Snyder, III.&nbsp; 
There is a candidate: Philip, b. c.1820.&nbsp; He is listed in the 1850 census 
for Albion, Calhoun Co., MI, aged 30 and born in New York.<sup><a href="#34">34</a></sup>&nbsp; 
He is living with Betsey (26 and b. NY), Mary A (2) and Ezra A (5 months).&nbsp; 
Both children were born in Michigan, so he would have had to have left New York 
before 1848.&nbsp; The same Philip (40) and Betsey (34) are listed in Albion in 
1860.<sup><a href="#35">35</a></sup>&nbsp; They then had Mary (12), Ezra (10), 
Frank (8), John (6), Miron (2) as family members.&nbsp; In the 1870 census, only 
Betsey (43) is listed as the head of household.<sup><a href="#36">36</a></sup>&nbsp; 
This suggests that Philip may have died between 1860 and 1870.&nbsp; Members 
listed in the household were Ezra (20), Frank (18), John (15), Myron (11), 
Jennie (8), and Hattie (4).&nbsp; If this is the correct Philip, his estimated 
birth date of 1820 would make him a probable twin of Peter.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>Louisa</b> and her husband Samuel Learn had children: Mortimer (c.1844-1909), 
Morgan (b. c.1846), Amelia (b. c.1849), Jane Adelaide &quot;Addie&quot; (Willison) (24 Feb 
1851 in Cattaraugus, New York-20 Mar 1931), Julia (b. c.1856), Helen (b. 
c.1859), and Willie (8 Oct 1870?-26 Oct 1877).&nbsp; They were living in 
Hinsdale, Cattaraugus Co., NY in 1850<sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup> and they eventually moved to 
Hickory Corners, Barry Co., Michigan.<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup></p>

<p><b>Phebe</b> was said by her brother Peter to have been a &quot;Pifer&quot;.<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp; 
In the 1840 census for Hinsdale, Cattaraugus Co., NY,<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup> 
Lorenzo is listed immediately after a Jacob Pipher whose household contained 
Jacob (aged 70-80), a female (aged 50-60), and a male and a female both aged 
15-20.&nbsp; The younger male may have been Lorenzo's sister's husband John, who 
would have been aged 20.&nbsp; In the 1850 census for Hinsdale, John Pipher 
(aged 30) is listed with wife Pheba (aged 24) and children Helen (6), Martha 
(4), and Peter Pipher (25).<sup><a href="#27">27</a></sup>&nbsp; Jacob Pipher is 
also listed in the 1850 census<sup><a href="#29">29</a></sup> (aged 87) and 
interestingly he has in his household a Sarah Snyder (aged 14) and Philip Snyder 
(aged 20).&nbsp; Could these be descendants of Philip Snyder, Jr.?&nbsp; In 
1860, John (aged 40) and Phebe (aged 35) are listed in Hinsdale with Hellen 
(17), Martha (15), George (9), Eveline (7), Charles (4), and John (1).<sup><a href="#28">28</a></sup>&nbsp; 
These census records suggest that Phebe was born about 1825, which is at odds 
with Peter's statement that he was the youngest child in the family.&nbsp; Also, 
if Philip died in 1824, Phebe would have had to have been born soon after.&nbsp; 
However, since this Pipher family is closely associated with the Snyders in 
Hinsdale and since both Phebe and Pipher are relatively uncommon names, it is 
almost certain that this Phebe Pipher is the daughter of Philip Snyder, Jr.</p>

&quot;In 1815, Benjamin, Peter, and Philip Snyder came to Ball Hill. The first took 
the REMY place, Peter the WHITBECK farm, and Philip the east portion of the 
lands of the brothers Orlando G. and Andrew BROWN. … Philip Snyder sold to D. 
ADAMS in 1838, and from him title descended to Ira MERRILLS and Jairus COLEGROVE, 
who sold to the brothers named. Benjamin Snyder sold to E. MACOMBER and H. 
GREEN. J. DAVIDSON, S. PHIPPS, S. R. HICKOK, and J. DEWEY were successive owners 
prior to John REMY, the present possessor. Peter Snyder and Captain GRANBY, a 
sea-captain in the war of 1812, were almost simultaneous settlers on this farm. 
The captain soon died. SNYDER sold to John CHAMBERLIN, he to I. W. MITCHELL, and 
Hart and Murray, Isaac GIFFORD, and Jacob WHITBECK…&quot;.&nbsp; Note: In New York, a 
&quot;town&quot; represents a subdivision of a county (analogous to a township) and not a 
settlement or village.&nbsp; A potential problem with this history is that it 
says that Philip Snyder sold to D. Adams in 1838. We know from Peter Snyder's 
(b. 1820) history that his father Philip Snyder died in about 1824. However, it 
is possible that this indicates that the heirs of Philip Snyder (i.e. his wife 
Mary) sold the land in 1838. </font></p>

This household is not listed under the oldest male, who is Henry Snyder (aged 
45).&nbsp; Rather the head of household is listed as Perry M Ramsey (age 28).&nbsp; 
It is likely that Arminda Ramsey (age 18) is his wife and a daughter of Henry 
Snyder.&nbsp; The others listed in the household are all Snyders and presumably 
children of Henry: Lydia (aged 24), Polly (aged 20), Peter (aged 18), John (aged 
12).</font></p>

one male 26-45 (Philip aged 38), one male 10-16 (Lorenzo aged 11, older two boys 
not with the family? Henry may have stayed with his Sharpsteen grandfather - see 
above), three males under 10 (Cornelius aged 9, William aged 8, Walter 3), one 
female 26-45 (Mary aged 33), one female 10-16 (Lydia aged 13?), two females 
under 10 (Mary aged 1 and ?).&nbsp; 
According to the census records (above) Louisa and Phebe were born after Peter, 
which contradicts Peter's statement that he was the youngest child of the 
family.&nbsp; Of course it is possible that he said something like &quot;I was the youngest boy&quot; 
and that was misrepresented as &quot;youngest child&quot;.</p>
