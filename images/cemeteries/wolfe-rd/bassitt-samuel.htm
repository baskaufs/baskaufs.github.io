<p>The tombstone of Samuel Bassitt is located in the old Sproat Cemetery on 
Wolfe Road in Bath Township, Allen County, Ohio.&nbsp; It is in the back row, 
near the south end of a line of tombstones marking the graves of many early Bath 
Township residents who immigrated from Trumbull County, Ohio and were associated 
with the Bassett, Doud, and Edgecomb families.&nbsp; The only stone to the south 
of Samuel's is the <a href="bassett-mary.htm">stone which may be of his daughter 
Mary</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2007, a large conifer tree has nearly overtopped 
the stone, shading it and making it difficult to read (see below).&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left">In 1975, the situation was quite different.&nbsp; The stone was 
in the open and more easy to read in afternoon lighting (see above).&nbsp; Since 
this tombstone is the only known source of information about the birth date of 
Samuel Bassitt, and since it is difficult to read, a careful analysis of its 
text is in order.</p>
<p><b>Analysis of dates based on enhanced image and historical data: </b></p>
<p>It is known that Samuel died in 1865. So that date provides samples of the 
style of the digits 1,5,6, and 8. It is also clear from the image that the month 
of death was April. The digits of the day of the month appear to be 1 and 6 with 
both of those digits matching the known samples of 1 and 6 from the year. 
Therefore the date of death appears to be April 16, 1865. According to family 
legend, when Samuel was on his deathbed he wasn't told about Lincoln's death 
because as an ardent Republican, it would have been too upsetting to him. Given 
that Abraham Lincoln died on April 15, 1865, both the date of death and the 
family legend are supported. </p>
<p>There is no known record of Samuel's exact date of birth (i.e. month and 
date) from any source other than this tombstone. The 1840 census lists him as 
aged between 40 and 50, giving a birth date between 1790 and 1800. The 1850 
census lists him as aged 56. That makes his birth date about 1794 (depending on 
when the census data were collected). The 1860 census lists him as aged 64, 
which places his birth date at about 1796. Assuming that he was born 
approximately 1795, his age at death would be approximately 70 years. Because 
the script type of the age is different from that of the death date, we do not 
have any numerals to compare with for the age. However, it is clear from the 
image that his age was 70, which is in agreement with the census data. The 
character following the 70 is not clear, however it would logically be a symbol 
for years and given that, it can be assumed that the character is a capital &quot;Y&quot;. 
It also appears from the end of the date that the abbreviations are followed by 
periods. So the two characters following the &quot;70&quot; are &quot;Y.&quot; </p>
<p>The typical format for ages on tombstones of that era was years, months, 
days. However, there are not enough characters for all three age units. The next 
to last character clearly looks like a lower case &quot;d&quot; rather than an &quot;m&quot;. So it 
must be assumed that the last set of age characters represent days. Given the 
apparent position of a large round character between the &quot;Y.&quot; and the &quot;d.&quot;, the 
lack of other marks indicative of characters before or after it, and the 
necessity of spaces before and after it, it appears that there is only a single 
numeral for the days unit. The roundness of the character makes the only 
possible numerals 0, 2, 3, 6, 8, or 9. 0 can be eliminated if there is a single 
digit. Of the remaining possibilities, 9 is the most likely. The bottom of the 
numeral does not look straight or pointed enough to be a 2. There does not 
appear to be any indication of a mark on the lower left part of the numeral, 
which would argue against 6 or 8. The large indentation in the upper left of the 
numeral is more consistent with a 9 than a 3. Comparison with other tombstones 
in the cemetery shows that <a href="edgecomb-ezra-enhanced39059-web.jpg">Ezra 
Edgecomb's</a> was probably carved by the same mason. The style is identical to 
Samuel Bassitt's and the date is about three years later. His stone reads June 
21, 1868, 55 Y. 7 m. 27 d. (corroborated with known dates). The 2 in the 27 is 
not at all the same as the day digit on Samuel Bassitt's stone. So it can be 
concluded with some confidence that Samuel Bassitt's birth date was April 7, 
1795. Given the uncertainty in the identity of the day digit, his birth date 
could be as late as April 13, 1795 if the digit were a 3. </p>
