<p>Phineas Edgecomb was a son of John Edgecomb (brother to <a href="2.htm">Uriah</a> 
b.1781) and Elizabeth Olmstead Edgecomb. He was born on 5 Sep 1795<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> in Canton, Hartford Co., Connecticut<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>. His 
mother died at the age of 26, when he was six years old. He was first married to 
Mariah (or Mary Ann) Brooks in &quot;New Mulberry&quot;<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> 
(probably New Marlborough), MA on 20 Sep 
1832. There were three children born to this marriage, with two living to 
adulthood: </p>

  <dt><b>John V.</b>&nbsp; 9 Mar 1836 Ohio - 1897. </dt>
</dl>
<p>It may be that Mariah died from complications related to childbirth since her 
death in Trumbull County was only eight days after the birth of John V. <sup>
<a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>After the death of Mariah, Phineas went from Ohio to Chenango Co., NY to 
marry Mairah, a sister of his first wife who was recently widowed. They had one 
child who died at a young age. In 1842, Phineas bought land in the northeast 
corner of section 14 of Bath Township, Allen Co., OH (across the road from 
<a href="3.htm">Samuel and Elsie Bassitt</a>) from <a href="7.htm">John</a> and 
<a href="5.htm">Fanny (Doud)</a> Lewis, brother-in-law and 
sister of <a href="2.htm">Betsy (Doud) Edgecomb</a> who was the wife of Phineas' uncle 
<a href="2.htm">Uriah</a>. In the 
deed, both parties are listed as &quot;of Warren, Trumbull Co., Ohio&quot;. In 1843 
Phineas moved to his land in Allen County. </p>
<p>Phineas' third marriage was to Tabitha J. Shafer (15 Jan 1826 - 30 Aug 1894) 
of Auglaize Co., OH on 1 Mar 1846, and they had eleven children (all born in 
Allen County, Ohio)<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>: </p>

<p>The relationship between Phineas and his oldest son, Luther, is hard to 
understand. In 1850, Luther, (aged 16) was not living at home. In 1860, he was 
living in New Marlborough, Berkshire Co., MA - perhaps living with friends or 
relatives of his mother? In contrast, his brother John was living at home with 
his father during that whole time period. In 1870, Luther was living in Bath 
Twp., Allen Co., OH with his son Charles in the household of Elias Everett. He 
is listed as a &quot;lecturer&quot; (perhaps a school teacher?). This location was only 
about a mile down the road from where his father lived. But by 1880, his family 
seems to have lost contact with him and said simply that he lived &quot;somewhere in 
the west&quot;.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Phineas was a charter member of the Lima Masonic Lodge and was well-known for 
his orchards. &quot;The cultivation and improvement of fruit has been his pride and 
delight, and he has one of the finest orchards in the county, and his fruit 
cannot be exceeded. A farmer who has been awarded the first premium on apples 
for a number of years finally revealed the fact that the fruit came from Mr. 
Edgecomb's orchard.&quot; <sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Frank P. Edgecomb recalled in an interesting interview (recorded in 1944 when 
he was 92 years old) that &quot;when we were boys, Philo Bassett [son of 
<a href="l.htm">Sarah Edgecomb Bassett</a>] and I had never made rails but we wanted to try. [Split rails 
were used by pioneers for fences.] We made 4000 for my father [Phineas], 5000 
for <a href="l.htm">Lew Bassett</a> (Philo's father) and 17 000 for Almon Hadsell. By that time we 
felt as if we knew how to make rails!&quot;<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> This story gives just one indication of 
the amount of hard manual labor that was involved in farming at that time, as 
well as the large number of trees that were being cut as the virgin forest was 
destroyed. In addition to farming, Phineas Edgecomb was also a carpenter. He 
died on 14 Mar 1881. <sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup></p>

<p><font size="2"><a href="census/1860-ma-berkshire-new-marlborough-566.jpg">
1860 New Marlborough, Berkshire Co., MA p.566&nbsp; Luther B. Edgecomb</a></font><br>
<font size="2">In this record, Luther, aged 26 (inferred birthdate c.1834) is 
living in the household of Henry (aged 65) and Linda (aged 60) Sheldon with 
their (apparently) unmarried children Eliza M. (aged 26 and a &quot;spinster&quot;), 
Elizur (? aged 26 and twin of Eliza), John D. (aged 21), and Edward E. (aged 
19). Who were they, and why was Luther living with them? I don't doubt that this 
is the right Luther, as his age agrees with the 1870 and 1900 censuses and 
unlike the rest of the household, he is listed as born in Ohio. Perhaps Linda 
Sheldon was Linda Brooks Sheldon and an aunt. Although the census index lists 
the town as Marlborough, the census image makes it clear that it is actually New 
Marlborough which is in southwestern Massachusetts and about 35 miles from 
Canton, Connecticut where Phineas was born. I think that it is likely that the 
&quot;New Mulberry&quot; mentioned in the 1880 Allen Co. Democrat article is actually New 
Marlborough. If the reporter wrote this from a verbal interview the names would 
have sounded very similar. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The 1860 census index for New Marlborough lists about 20 
Brooks, including a Luther Brooks, aged 58, possibly a son of the 1790 Luther 
Brooks, possibly a brother of the Brooks sisters who married Phineas. Why Luther 
was not living with his father (who had been remarried for years by that time) 
and brother John in Bath Township, Allen Co., OH is a mystery. Perhaps there was 
&quot;bad blood&quot; between Phineas and Luther as evidenced by the apparent lack of 
communication hinted at in the 1880 article. Where was Luther in 1850?</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><a href="census/1870-oh-allen-bath-323.jpg">1870 Bath Twp., 
Allen Co., OH, p.323&nbsp; Luther Edgecomb</a><br>
In this record, Luther, now 36 is living with his son Charles (aged 6, born in 
NY) in the household of Elias and Marilla Everett. I know who they are - their 
daughter Alice (listed as aged 14) was later the wife of Philo Bassett who was 
the son of Lewis and Sarah (Edgecomb) Bassitt. Why he is living there, I don't 
know. Their home was about 3/4 of a mile from where Phineas lived, so he 
certainly was living near his family. On this census record, he was described as 
&quot;Lecturer&quot;. At first I thought it was &quot;laborer&quot;, which was a common description 
for young men who were not heads of households. However, the Everett boys (half 
brothers to Alice) were described as &quot;farm laborers&quot; and it seems fairly clear 
on the image that the word is &quot;lecturer&quot;. I don't know exactly what that means. 
My guess would be &quot;school teacher&quot;, but why didn't they just say that? </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><a href="census/1880-ks-morris-valley-451.jpg">1880 Morris 
Valley, Morris Co., KS&nbsp; L. Edgecomb, wife Anna E. Edgecomb, aged 30, born in OH, daughter 
Maggie M., aged 7, born in OH.</a></font><br>
<font size="2">The &quot;L. Edgecomb&quot; listed here was aged 48. That would put his 
birth date at about 1832 rather than 1834 as suggested by the other census 
records. He is listed as born in Ohio, which matches with the 1860 and 1870 
censuses. His father is listed as born in Mass (the old-style &quot;Mafs&quot; if I'm 
reading the script correctly), which would not be correct (should be Conn.) but 
given that his Mother was from there, this could be excusable. The birthplace of 
mother is given as Ohio (should be Mass?), which is also not right, but given 
that his family had lived there, it could be a reasonable mistake, particularly 
if the wife was the one who gave the information to the census-taker. There is 
definitely a Maggie M. daughter. However, the George that is given in the index 
as &quot;something other than a direct relationship&quot; is clearly crossed out on the 
actual record. Likewise the age of 5 given in the index is clearly manufactured 
- there is nothing in the age column on the actual record. So why was a George 
written in and scratched out?</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><a href="census/1900-mo-taney-swan-13b.jpg">1900 Swan Twp., 
Taney Co., MO, p. 13b, Luther Edgecomb (living by himself),  born in Ohio, 
father and mother born in Ohio.</a></font><br>
<font size="2">Unfortunately, this page is not very legible due to lightness of 
the ink and sloppiness on the part of the census-taker. Fortunately, Luther's 
entry is near the bottom where it is darker. His birth date is given as Nov. 
1833 if I am reading it properly - that fits with the listed age of 66 and 
census date of June 1900 and would work with the 1860 and 1870 census ages. I 
have some difficulty recognizing the name as Luther, although whomever indexed 
this seemed to recognize the name. His marital status is not clear. It looks 
like it was &quot;m&quot; but perhaps &quot;w&quot; was scribbled over that. That would make sense 
if second wife Anna had died between 1895 and 1900.&nbsp; Luther apparently 
bought land in Taney Co. in 1904.</font></p>
