Jasper Snyder (1854-1926) and grandson of Peter Snyder (1820-1900)</font></b></p>
<p>In 2000, this information was found on a Snyder family history website 
created by Van Snyder.&nbsp; However, I can no longer find the information 
posted on the Internet and have entered this from a printout I made that year. I 
have tried to type the information in as it was on the website, although I have 
corrected a few obvious typing errors.&nbsp; The footnotes inserted and their 
associated comments are mine.&nbsp; Steve Baskauf, 2007</p>
<p>&quot;The following text is copied in full unedited from a 3 page collection 
of information distributed in 1956, and held in the file since then of the 
current president of the family reunion.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>

<p align="left">Since I am the eldest of the Jasper Snyder family, I have been 
asked to tell you what I remember of the family background and history.</p>
<p><a href="../g.htm">Peter Snyder</a>, a Dutchman from Pennsylvania<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> (my grandfather) walked all the 
way from Pennsylvania to Shawnee Township, Ohio where he settled.&nbsp; This 
location is south of Lima.&nbsp; Grandfather's sole possessions consisted of the 
clothes he wore and an ax.&nbsp; Here he met a young red-haird German girl by 
the name of Edgecomb, who could not speak English.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>&nbsp; They married and raised 
a family of eight children - 6 boys and 2 girls - Hannah<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> (I called her Aunt Het), 
who married Charlie Shinaberry; Anne, who married John Protchman<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>, and who moved 
west to Kansas for awhile.&nbsp; The boys were George, the eldest, who grew up, 
married and raised a large family.&nbsp; Walt who went to Texas to work in the 
oil fields, had a family of 3.&nbsp; Next were Newt, Jasper and Clay.&nbsp; Clay 
also worked in the oil fields on the derricks.&nbsp; He fell off of one of these 
and broke his leg.&nbsp; Some of you probably remember Uncle Clay (who used 
crutches) when he was here for the Golden Wedding anniversary of Jasper and 
Alice Snyder in October (1922).&nbsp; Besides those mentioned there was another 
boy (I can't remember his name) who was stolen by the Indians and was tortured 
and killed.&nbsp; Grandfather wanted to bring his body back home.&nbsp; Someway 
he learned where the body was, took a team and wagon and went after him.&nbsp; 
To protect and conceal the body he had a load of turnips.&nbsp; He found the 
boy's body, put it in the bottom of the wagon, covered it with turnips and 
brought it safely home for burial.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>&nbsp; When the family was nearly raised, 
Grandmother was bitten on the toe by a rattlesnake and died.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>&nbsp; Grandfather 
then moved to Allen County, Ohio, and settled 9 miles outside of Lima on the 
Lima Findlay Pike.&nbsp; Here he met and married a widow by the name of Bassett<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>, 
with several children.&nbsp; They in turn had three children, Alta, the eldest; 
Ida, who died when she was 21 years of age; and Della, who marred a doctor much 
older than herrself, by the name of Kaiser.&nbsp; The lived in McComb, Ohio.&nbsp; 
The had 2 boys, Ned and Jimmy.&nbsp; Jimmy was hurt when he was a baby and 
playing with the other children and was always crippled after that.&nbsp; This 
family of 17 lived together in a large house with a center hall, much like the 
picture in the paper this past week of the house that was President Eisenhower's 
birthplase in Texas, only larger.&nbsp; I played many times in this house with 
my Uncles and Aunts.</p>
<p>Now, I can't tell you much about the courtship of Jasper and Alice Anne 
Lackey, but Alice Ann Lackey was an auburn haired English-Scotch girl and my 
father used to often call her a blue-blooded Yankee.&nbsp; They married and were 
blessed with 11 children, 7 boys and 4 girls - Calvin, Warren, Stella, Maud, 
Jay, Charlie (who died of diptheria when he was 21), Arthur (who died when he 
was a small baby), Ethel, Florence, Peter and Floyd.</p>
<p>When Warren and I were little our parents lived with grandfather on the 
Lima-Findlay Pike.<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>&nbsp; Here are some incidents that I remember well while we 
were living there.&nbsp; You know in those days all live stock - cattle, sheep 
or pigs - were driven on foot to market.&nbsp; Warren and I used to follow the 
fence and watch the stock being driven through.&nbsp; Then one summer the army 
potato bugs came in such droves they went right through the house, covering the 
curtains and everything.&nbsp; There wasn't much left of any potatoes that year.&nbsp; </p>
<p>From here we moved to the Herb Voor<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup> place further west, and here Stella was 
born.&nbsp; At about two years of age she contracted lung fever and always had 
asthma afterward.&nbsp; Maud was born here too.</p>
<p>Here hunting was always good - squirrels, red, grey and black, black 
squirrels being about the same size as the grey squirrels.&nbsp; I was often 
that I carried 5 squirrels at a time.&nbsp; Father was a good hunter.&nbsp; One 
evening he said, 'Cal, tomorrow we get up early.&nbsp; I watched a flock of wild 
turkeys settle for the night and we're going to get one.'&nbsp; We got up early 
before it was daylight, covered our lantern with a red handkerchief and got our 
turkey.&nbsp; Pa also liked to hunt coons.&nbsp; Once we treed two at one time.&nbsp; 
The dogs got one - the other coon took after Warren and I and we high-tailed it 
for the house, but Pa got him.</p>
<p>From the Voor place we moved to the Ramsbottom farm and lived here in Allen 
County, Ohio for two or three years.&nbsp; Here Pa pulled a threshing machine 
with a team for two or three summers.&nbsp; The team, Sal and bird, were high 
strung horses and ran away often.&nbsp; One day the threshing machine gut up a 
head of steam and began to whistle.&nbsp; The team was off! - round and round 
the field, careening, nearly upsetting at every turn.&nbsp; Dad trying to catch 
them whenever they came near him.&nbsp; When they were winded pulling the heavy 
machine, we were able to catch up with them.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Jay, Charlie, Arthur, Ethel, Florence, Peter and Floyd were born in Paulding 
County, Ohio.&nbsp; When one of the children was a baby, the Jasper Snyder 
family moved to Paulding County.&nbsp; It was winter when they moved, so they 
put straw, blankets and a stove in the wagon bed to keep everyone warm.&nbsp; Pa 
kept a fire going hot enough to blister the new paint on the outside of the new 
wagon bed.&nbsp; Uncle Clay, Warren and I drove the cattle through, 80 miles on 
foot.&nbsp; We ate frozen beans on the trail.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Their new home here was two miles west of Broughton, Ohio a log house that Pa 
built that adjoined the 40 acres of heavy timberland belonging to him.&nbsp; 
When they started to clear a place for the house, they had to cut and burn the 
timber in order to have a place on which to put the house.&nbsp; The older boys 
and Pa worked there during the week, and one Sunday they decided to take the 
family to see where the new house would be built.&nbsp; When they came within 
sight of the pile of partly burned timber, Florence, who was a very small girl 
then, saw the scorched wood and cried out, 'Oh, goody! goody! I see our new 
house'.&nbsp; When the house was up, we moved in before it was completely 
finished.&nbsp; There were no doors of window panes in yet, so we used carpets 
at the doors and windows to keep out the weather.&nbsp; In the wintertime we had 
to shake the snow off the bedcovers in the morning when we got up.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I remember there was a ladder leading to the second floor instead of steps, 
and we had to go through a hole in the second floor in climbing the ladder to 
get upstairs.&nbsp; Maude walked in her sleep at times, and one night she woke 
up the family by running around in her sleep.&nbsp; Just as she called out, 
&quot;I've got you, Delmar', (very likely a schoolmate), she ran too close to the 
edge and fell through the hole.&nbsp; Luckily, she wasn't hurt.</p>
<p>When we lived here Dad cut stave bolts from timber and hauled them to the 
barrel factory to make barrels.&nbsp; This was one of the things he did to help 
make a living for the family.&nbsp; One rainy morning he and we older boys went 
out to cut some bolts, but the rain continued, so he said, 'you boys go to the 
house and dry the saw (a crosscut) and put it away'.&nbsp; My father was always 
most particular and careful with his tools.&nbsp; I put one end of the saw on a 
chair and the other on the floor while I went to find a cloth to dry the saw.&nbsp; 
Warren, in the meantime, had picked up the baby who was crying and in walking to 
the other side of the room with the baby, he did not see the saw and ran into 
it, cutting his leg quite badly.&nbsp; (The scar is probably still there).&nbsp; 
The leg did not heal for a long time, even though we tried everything we knew to 
heal it.&nbsp; Finally someone told us to get some lamb's wool and burn it on 
coal and apply it, which we did.&nbsp; In a short time the leg was quite healed.</p>
<p>I remember Pa made a bench for the children to sit on at the table, and each 
child had his own place and no one ever traded places at the table.&nbsp; Pa and 
Ma were very strict about the children's manners and expecially so at the table, 
and if someone appeard without his hair combed or his hands washed, he was not 
allowed to eat until he mad himself presentable.&nbsp; Even though my parents 
were very strict, they allowed each child to select his own food.&nbsp; Of 
course he was expected to eat all he put on his plate.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Please send in your written contribution to the history of the Snyder family 
as soon as possible, and no later than March 31, 1957, so they can all be 
assembled for the next meeting.</p>

<p>Personal experiences, memories of events (your own or otherwise if you have 
heard interesting accounts of happenings in the Snyder family) of whatever you 
care to add to this history will be gladly received.&nbsp; Please send material 
to : Faye Severns 1018 Pemberton Drive Fort Wayne, Indiana&nbsp; Phone: Anthony

<p><b>Notes:</b></p>

<p><a name="1"></a>1. The was apparently the reunion of Jasper Snyder 
descendants held in Indiana, and not the Bassett-Edgecomb-Snyder Reunion held in 
Lima, Ohio.</p>

<p><a name="2"></a>2. It is known that Peter Snyder was born in New York and 
also lived in Trumbull County, Ohio and Bath Twp., Allen County, Ohio before he 
moved to Shawnee Twp., Allen County.&nbsp; However, it is possible that this bit 
of information as well as others in the first part of this story actually 
referred to Peter's father, <a href="../1.htm">Philip</a>.&nbsp; This may be an 
indication that Philip was born in Pennsylvania, or came to Pennsylvania with 
his father Philip before settling in New York.&nbsp; </p>

<p><a name="3"></a>3. Although we do not know what color <a href="../g.htm">
Clarinda Edgecomb</a>'s hair was, there is no chance that she was German or that 
she could not speak English.&nbsp; All of her known ancestors were English and 
had lived in North America for generations.&nbsp; Again, this may refer to the 
preceding generation: <a href="../1.htm">Mary Sharpsteen, the wife of Philip 
Snyder, Jr.</a></p>
<p><a name="4"></a>4. Henrietta</p>
<p><a name="5"></a>5. Prottsman</p>
<p><a name="6"></a>6. This story could not have involved a son of Peter Snyder 
(1820-1900) because he was not married until 1840 and by that time the Native 
Americans in Allen County, Ohio had already been removed to Kansas.&nbsp; If 
this story referred to a son of Peter's father Philip, then it would have 
probably occurred in New York.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a name="7"></a>7. A version of this story is also told by descendants of Amy 
Snyder Mason.&nbsp; However, it is clear that Clarinda didn't die from the 
snakebite.&nbsp; She was bitten at their farm in Shawnee but did not die until 
1866, years after the family had moved back to Bath Township in 1862.</p>
<p><a name="8"></a>8. Actually Ellen Baker Kollor.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a name="9"></a>9. Now known as the Old Dixie Highway.&nbsp; This farm was at 
the corner of the Dixie and Thayer Rd.</p>
