  <p>The Everetts interacted with the Edgecomb, Bassitt/Bassett families as 
  neighbors or through marriage. They were also members of the Disciples Church 
  as were the Bassitts and Edgecombs. As immigrants who came from New York via 
  Trumbull County, Ohio, it seems appropriate to briefly outline their 
  connection with the Edgecombs and Bassitts.<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup> </a></p>
  <p>The Everetts originated in New Jersey, where the name was typically spelled 
  &quot;Everit&quot;. Nathan Everit was born 4 Nov 1780<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> in 
  Sussex Co., NJ. His mother was Thankful Everit. He married Mary Doty, born on 
  15 Jan 1789<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> and daughter of Benjamin and Mary 
  Doty.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> In 1813, Nathan and Mary were living in 
  Chemung Co., New York.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> They may have lived in 
  Solon, Cortland Co., NY in 1826 because Hannah Everett (Edgecomb), their 
  granddaughter through son Jacob D. was born there in that year. That would 
  have placed them in Solon at the same time that <a href="3.htm">Samuel and 
  Elsa Bassitt</a> lived there. Nathan and Mary had the following children: </p>
  <p><b>Abram (or Abraham)</b> 28 Dec 1801 in Sussex Co., NJ - 3 Jun 1878 in 
  Cortland, OH, m. Mary (Polly) Bush <br>
  <b>George</b> <br>
  <b>Benjamin</b> m. 3 Mar 1833 Catherine Laramore in Trumbull Co., OH <br>
  <b>Jacob Doty</b> 27 Feb 1807 in Erie Co., NY - 30 May 1852 in Monroe Twp., 
  Allen Co., OH, m. 30 Dec 1828 to Elizabeth &quot;Betsey&quot; Bush 12 Feb 1806 - 16 Dec 
  1878<sup><a href="#6">6</a> <a href="#7">7</a></sup> <br>
  <b>Alexcina (or Lexcina) (Smith)(Faunce)</b> c. 1811 in NY - 30 Mar 1860 in 
  Trumbull Co., OH, m.(2) Robert S. Faunce <br>
  <b>Martin</b> <br>
  <b>Nathan</b> 22 Jul 1816 in NY - 3 Jul 1901 in Bazetta Twp., Trumbull Co., 
  OH, m. 7 Oct 1841 to <a href="5.htm">Cynthia Lewis</a> <br>
  <b><a href="5eb.htm">Elias</a></b> 8 May 1817 in NY - 22 Feb 1885 in Bath 
  Twp., Allen Co., OH, m.(1) 19 Nov 1846 to <a href="5.htm">Esther Olmstead</a>, 
  m.(2) 13 Oct 1853 to Marellah Lippencott Trumbo<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>, 
  m.(3) Mahala Roberts Fields. <br>
  <b>Thankful </b><br>
  <b>Mary</b> </p>
  <p>Of these children, George, Abram, Benjamin, Jacob D., Alexcina, and Nathan 
  were known to have lived in Trumbull County, OH. It is interesting to note 
  that family members that stayed in Trumbull Co. tended to spell their name &quot;Everitt&quot;, 
  while those who came to Allen Co. spelled it &quot;Everett&quot;. Tradition says that a 
  misunderstanding between the brothers caused the change in spelling. </p>
  <p>George was the first known to have moved to Trumbull Co., Ohio. In 1828, he 
  was the teacher at the first school in Lordstown, which was located on
  <a href="7.htm">David Lewis</a>' farm. (This school has been noted in the 
  Bassett and Lewis histories as the location where the Disciples church was 
  organized in 1830.) Abram and Jacob D., who married the sisters Polly and 
  Elizabeth Bush, respectively, moved to Lordstown Twp., Trumbull Co. in about 
  1830. Benjamin may have moved there at about the same time, since he was 
  married there in 1833. He may have later come to Allen Co. Nathan lived with 
  his widowed sister, Alexcina Smith when they came to Trumbull Co. Nathan told 
  a grandson that when he and his brother came on horseback to Ohio, they had to 
  swim the Allegheny River because there were no bridges at that time. After 
  their arrival in Trumbull Co., Lexcina married Robert S. Faunce and on 7 Oct 
  1841 Nathan married Cynthia Lewis, the daughter of <a href="5.htm">John and 
  Fanny (Doud) Lewis</a>. </p>
  <p>In 1835, Jacob Doty and Elizabeth Everett moved to Allen County. &quot;As there 
  was no road within three-quarters of a mile of the property, he had to 'blaze' 
  the trees in order to make his way to and from his home. He became the owner 
  of 280 acres of land, the greater part of which he cleared during his life. 
  The log house which he built for his home is still standing as a reminder of 
  the hardy and enduring character of the brave old pioneer.&quot;<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup> 
  Their daughter, Hannah married <a href="i.htm">Marquis Edgecomb</a>, son of
  <a href="2.htm">Uriah and Betsy Edgecomb</a>.<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>In 1836, Jacob D. and Betsey were followed by Jacob's parents, Nathan and 
  Mary (Doty) Everett, who were said to have moved to Trumbull Co. and spent one 
  winter there before moving to Allen Co., the following spring<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup>. 
  The Everetts settled in southwestern Monroe Township, where Edgecombs and 
  Lewis's from Trumbull Co. were settling. </p>
  <p><a href="5eb.htm">Account of Elias Everett</a>.</p>
  <p>Mary (Doty) Everett died on 29 Sep 1866 and Nathan died on 18 Jul 1858 and 
  both were buried in the Williams Cemetery on the Lincoln Highway (U.S. 30) in 
  Section 25 of Monroe Twp., ¼ mi. east of Thayer Rd. </p>

This would mean that he was born on 4 Nov 1780. The 1850 Census gives his age as 
70, which would indicate a birth date of about 1780. Sarah Grove gives his birth 
date as 28 Feb 1776. </font></p>

14 d.&quot;. This would mean that she was born on 15 Jan 1789. The 1850 Census gives 
her age as 63, which would indicate a birth date of about 1787. Sarah Grove 
gives her birth date as 1778. The 1789 birth date causes some difficulty with 
the birth date of 1801 for her son Abram. Further research is warranted to 
resolve this issue. </font></p>
