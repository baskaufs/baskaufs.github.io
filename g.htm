<p>Clarinda Edgecomb was born 11 Dec 1822<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> in 
northeastern Ohio. When she was about 10 years old, her <a href="2.htm">family</a> 
moved to the wilderness of Bath Township in Allen County, Ohio. In the ensuing 
years, members of a number of other Trumbull County families also moved west to 
Allen County. One such person was Peter Snyder, born 13 Aug 1820.<sup><a href="#35">35</a></sup> In 1839, at 
the age of 19, Peter followed his brother, <a href="1.htm">Lorenzo</a>, to Bath 
Township<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. Upon his arrival, he began working as a 
farm laborer. It is thought that an elder <a href="s1.htm">Peter Snyder who married Betsey 
(Lewis) Snyder</a> was an uncle or cousin and the younger Peter may have worked for him 
(see the speculation <a href="s1.htm#lived">here</a>).&nbsp; During this time 
Peter became acquainted with the 16-17 year-old Clarinda 
(whose family lived near the elder Peter's farm) and she became pregnant.<sup><a href="#2a">2a</a></sup>&nbsp; 
On 9 April 1840, Peter and Clarinda were married.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></p>

<p><b>Marilla (Reed) (Mason)</b>, b. 28 Mar 1842. Marilla Snyder married a man 
named Reed. This was probably when they lived in Shawnee, because there were 
several Reed families in the area there.&nbsp; She had two sons from this 
marriage: William and Arthur.&nbsp; Rilla's second marriage was 
to Sumner F. Mason , and they lived on a farm in Bath Township on Stewart Road 
three quarters of a mile south of Bluelick Road.

<p>In 1849, Peter and Clarinda bought a 47 acre farm in Bath Township on what is 
now the Old Dixie Highway just northeast of Bluelick Road. This was just west of 
where <a href="2.htm">Clarinda's father</a> was living with her brother 
<a href="i.htm">Marquis</a> and sister Anna.<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup> 
They later added 100 acres to this and lived there until about 1856, when they 
sold the farm and moved to Shawnee Township.<sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup> </p>

<p>Their farm in Shawnee was located along the Ottawa River just north of Adgate 
Rd. on what is now called Fort Amanda Rd.&nbsp; One day while walking along a 
small stream on the farm, Clarinda was bitten on the ankle by a rattlesnake. Her 
family quickly put her foot into a bucket of fresh milk, which supposedly drew 
the poison out of the wound and curdled the milk. They put her foot in another 
bucket of milk until it curdled. They repeated this again and again until the 
milk no longer curdled and they know that all of the poison had been drawn out. 
She thus survived the bite of the snake.<a href="#21"><sup>21</sup></a>&nbsp; In 
another version of the story, Clarinda was bitten on the  toe by a 
rattlesnake and died of the bite.<sup><a href="#21a">21a</a></sup></p>
<p>By the time of the 1860 census, there 
were ten children, aged one month to nineteen years, all under one roof. But 
this was not to last. In 1861, the Civil War broke out and in October of that 
year, seventeen year old William enlisted as a private in the 81st Ohio 
Volunteer Infantry. Less than a year later, in June of 1862, he was dead.<sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup> On 
July 6 the oldest son, Josiah was married to his next door neighbor, Clarissa 
Reed, daughter of Samuel and Mary (Akers) Reed of Fairfield Co. (This may be the 
same Reed family of Marilla's first husband.) But only a month later, he 
enlisted as a private in the 99th O.V.I. and left home. By December, he died in 
Nashville, Tennessee, leaving behind his widow, pregnant with their first child, 
Pet Snyder, who was born the next year.<sup><a href="#23">23</a></sup> Both of the Snyder boys were buried in 
the old cemetery at the corner of Zurmehly and Shawnee Roads.&nbsp;

<p>In 1862, the family sold out and moved back to Bath Township. There they 
bought the <a href="bes-tour.htm#snyder-homestead">farm on Sugar Creek Road</a> one half mile west of Slabtown Road. A 
distinctive feature of this farm was the <a href="bes-tour.htm#snyder-homestead">large brick house</a> that would eventually 
be occupied by four generations of Snyder descendants. </p>

<p>On 19 December 1866, Clarinda died at the age of 44. She had spent 23 out of 
her 26 years of marriage either pregnant, or caring for infants in diapers. She 
was <a href="bes-tour.htm#shawnee">buried in Shawnee next to her two sons</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Peter  remarried to Ellen (Baker) Kollor, widow of George W. Kollor and seventeen 
years his junior. Mrs. Kollor was born on 10 July 1837, the daughter of John and 
Arzilla (Minnis) Baker.&nbsp; By 1870, their household contained the six 
youngest children of Peter's first marriage, Talitha, Joseph, and George W. 
Kollar, Jr., children from Ellen's first marriage, and Alta, Peter and Ellen's 
child.&nbsp; Also living with the family was Peter's oldest daughter Marilla

three children, one of whom was Evelyn E. Grant Drew. At the time that she died 
in 1936, they lived in Kiefer, Oklahoma which was an oil town. </p>
<p>Many of these children were members of the Church of Christ. </p>
<p>In 1875, Peter bought a farm in Bath Township on Findlay Road (now the Old 
Dixie Highway) just southwest of Thayer Rd. Peter and Ellen lived there for the 
rest of their days. About this time, George, his oldest living son was married 
and lived on Peter's old farm on Sugar Creek Road. George later bought the farm 
from his father. </p>
<p>During his later years, Peter, a Republican, served as Township Trustee for 
several terms.<sup><a href="#34">34</a></sup> </p>
<p>In his last years, Peter's daughter Henrietta Shinnaberry and her family 
lived on his farm. Peter and Ellen lived in a little house just west of the 
Shinnaberrys. Lela (Shinnaberry) Jacobs remembered them butchering beef when she 
was a little girl. They would take a quarter of beef and hang it up over the 
stove to dry it. When Lela would go down to visit them, her &quot;Aunt Ellen&quot; (as she 
called her) would cut a piece off and give it to her. Lela thought that was 
pretty good! Her only memories of her Grandpa Snyder were that he had a 
moustache and was not a very large man. </p>
<p>Peter died on 1 Oct 1900 at the age of 80<sup><a href="#35">35</a></sup> and 
was buried in the <a href="bes-tour.htm#beaverdam">old Beaverdam Cemetery</a>.&nbsp; Lela remembered riding in her 
mother's lap in a horse and buggy on the way to his funeral. At her young age 
she couldn't understand why her mother felt so bad and was crying.<sup><a href="#36">36</a></sup> The process 
of settling Peter Snyder's estate among his eighteen children was immense and 
took years. Peter's executor was his son George, but George died before settling 
the estate, so the task fell to Dave Byerly, who was George's executor (George 
also had a large family).<sup><a href="#37">37</a></sup> One result of this is that tombstones for Peter, 
George, and Peter's first wife Clarinda were purchased at the same time. So 
although they are found in three different cemeteries, they all have the same 
style. Ellen Snyder lived for about five years after Peter died. She was ill for 
some time and had an operation to relieve her condition, but it failed and on 17 
January 1906 January she died.<sup><a href="#38">38</a></sup>

<p><font size="2"><a name="21"></a>21. This story was told by Amy Snyder Mason 
to her daughter Amy Mason Everett. 
<a href="pages/stories-told-by-amy-mason-everett.htm">The story was passed on to Shirley Everett 
Clark and Wib Everett, children of Amy Everett</a>, and was told to Steve Baskauf by 
Shirley and her cousin Michael Wildermuth.&nbsp; Although rattlesnakes do not 
now occur in northwest Ohio, the massasauga or swamp rattlesnake was formerly 
present throughout the northern and central parts of the state.&nbsp;&nbsp; They 
thrived in the huge wetlands originally present in northwestern Ohio.&nbsp; 
Habitat destruction has now caused the snake's range to have decreased 
considerably - the species was last seen in northern Ohio in the 1950's on the 
Catawba and Marblehead peninsulas near Toledo. The species' habitat is river 
bottoms and nearby fields, so the &quot;small stream&quot; of the story would have been a 
likely place to have encountered a massasauga.&nbsp; This rattlesnake species is 
not particularly aggressive, but it may bite if stepped on while it is quietly 
sunning itself concealed in vegetation.&nbsp; There are numerous folk remedies 
for rattlesnake venom.&nbsp; However, it is estimated that as many as 60%&nbsp; 
of bites of humans by poisonous snakes are &quot;dry&quot; bites where the snake injects 
little or no venom, saving it instead for actual prey.&nbsp; In another telling 
of the story, the snake was a copperhead, but it is questionable whether 
copperheads ever lived in this part of Ohio.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Here is a version of the story as told by Michael Wildermuth: 
&quot;Here is the rattlesnake story. I have heard both my mother [Margery Mason 
Wildermuth] and Shirley Clark tell it: [Clarinda] Edgecomb Snyder went down to 
the river (my assumption is the Ottawa River, which ran through their homestead 
in Shawnee Township, although I feel uncertain as to whether or not this 
location was actually mentioned) and, unfortunately, was bitten near the ankle 
by a rattlesnake (I assume an Eastern Massasauga, which are still native here). 
She called for help and, fortunately, was heard. When her rescuers discovered 
what happened, they called for buckets of fresh milk to be fetched from the barn 
or house and immediately plunged her foot into a bucket of milk. The milk 
curdled as it drew poison from her system. This was repeated until no effect was 
noticed in the milk. [Clarinda] survived.&quot;</font></p>

Army on 20 Sep 1864 served as a sergeant in the 180th Ohio Volunteer Infantry and 
was discharged in Jul 1865. This is <b>not</b> the George Snyder who was son of 
Peter Snyder, even though the grave of our George (b. 1846) has a G.A.R. (Grand 
Army of the Republic) marker, indicating that he was a Civil War veteran. 
Pension records from the National Archives show that this George Snider married 
Margaret McCain on 23 Oct 1856.&nbsp; The 
George who enlisted in 1864 is the only George Snyder listed from Allen County.&nbsp;

</a> The 1870 census, taken on 12 August, lists her age as 10/12 year. Either 
this was a mistake and should be 1/12 (making her born in 1870) or she was born 
in 1869 and was actually about a year old (and born in 1869). The latter seems 
more likely. The 1870 census supports this, giving her age as 10 on the 10th day 
of June 1880. </font>

Beaverdam Cemetery, Richland Twp., Allen Co., OH says &quot;PETER SNYDER DIED OCT 1,

handwriting in the Bible, the dates appear to have been written about 1899. 
There are numerous discrepancies in the dates in the Bible and since the account
