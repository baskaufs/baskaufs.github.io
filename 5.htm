<p>Jesse Doud and Lydia Shipman were probably married in Connecticut shortly 
before 1790. They are listed in the 1790 and 1800 census records as living in 
Bristol, CT and in Burlington, CT in 1810. They and members of their family 
followed their son Alvah and daughter <a href="2.htm">Betsey and her husband Uriah Edgecomb</a> as 
they moved westward. <a href="2.htm">Uriah</a> and Alva were listed as living in Preston, Chenango 
Co., New York in the 1810 census and <a href="2.htm">Uriah</a> and Alvah Doud sold land together 
there in 1815.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> In 1830 Jesse lived in Newton Twp., 
Trumbull Co., Ohio. </p>
<p>The proof of the connections among members of this family comes from the 
diary of Davis R. Doud. Here are some excerpts:<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> </p>
<p>&quot;Dec. 31, 1902. I was born in Braceville, Trumbull Co., Ohio in 1926 [sic, 
should be 1826], June 29. My earliest recollections of my life is of my mother's 
visit to my Grandfather Jesse Doud with me some two or three miles through a 
dense forest most of the way south of our home in Newton Township. My Mother was 
accompanied by one of my Father's sisters - Aunt Lydia Brown, I think. </p>
<p>&quot;A few years later I went to visit my Uncle George Olmstead who lived some 
four miles from our home near the Mahoning River where he owned a sawmill by 
which he lost one of his legs. </p>
<p>&quot;At the age of some 5 or 6 I went to stay with my sister Hannah Miller (my 
oldest sister) who then lived some six miles away in Warren, the County Seat of 
Trumbull County. </p>
<p>&quot;About the time that I was 6 years old, my uncle George Olmstead and my uncle 
<a href="2.htm">Uriah Edgecomb</a> by marriage to my Father's sisters moved to Allen County, Ohio, 
some 200 miles Westward through dense roads the most of the way. </p>
<p>&quot;On our way to and from that sale, my Father and I visited one of my aunts by 
the name of Rust<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Jan 1, 1903. This is a fine morning. I remember of seeing my Father's Father 
at the age of ten and eleven. I often walked over the fields with my Father's 
mother [Lydia Shipman Doud] who was then quite old. She died a year or so after 
my Father's [Alva Doud] death. I with one of my sisters and her husband attended 
her funeral. She died at her daughter's in Lordstown - Aunt Fanny 
<a href="7.htm">Lewis</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Based in this information, Jesse died in Newton Twp., Trumbull Co., OH 
in 1839<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> and Lydia died about c. 1839-40<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> 
at the home of her daughter Fanny <a href="7.htm">Lewis</a> in Lordstown, Trumbull Co., OH<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>.

</dl>
<p>Alvah was listed in the 1810 census as living in Preston, Chenango Co., NY<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup>. 
On 28 Jul 1811 in Preston, NY<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup>, Alvah married 
Martha &quot;Patty&quot; Rogers, born in Waterford, CT 14 Sep 1788. In 1820, 
Alvah was listed as living in Braceville, Trumbull Co., OH.<sup><a href="#31">31</a></sup>&nbsp; Alvah's son, Davis 
Rogers Doud, recalled that as a small boy in eastern Ohio he played with his 
cousin <a href="i.htm">Mark Edgecomb</a> (<a href="2.htm">Betsy and Uriah</a>'s son) before the Edgecombs moved to Allen 
County, OH.<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup> The two boys were about the same age 
and would have been about 5 years old at the time. Alvah died in Braceville, 
Trumbull Co., OH in 1839<sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup> and was buried in the 
old Braceville Cemetery in Trumbull Co., OH. His son, Alvah, Jr. and father 
Jesse were in attendance at the sale held 21 May 1839 after his death.<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup> 
In 1848, Martha went west to Gardner, Illinois where she died on 3 Jun 1869<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup>. 
She is buried in the Wheeler Cemetery near Gardner. Alva and Martha's son Davis 
was the father of Florence Margaret Carr and grandfather of Inez L. Eagleton who 
did much research on the Douds. </p>
<p>Lydia married Lewis Brown who died in Newton Twp., Trumbull Co., OH on 1 Apr 
1828.<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup> Her second marriage was to Stephen Brown 
who died in Newton Twp. on 18 Sep 1850 and is listed with her on the 1850 
census.<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup> Lydia's third marriage on 26 Jun 1851 was 
to a Peter Snyder of Milton Twp., Mahoning Co., OH (adjacent to Newton Twp of 
Trumbull Co).<sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup> It is not known what relationship, 
if any, this Peter Snyder is to the <a href="g.htm">Peter Snyder who married Clarinda Edgecomb</a> 
or to the <a href="1.htm">Peter Snyder</a> associated with the <a href="7.htm">Lewis family</a> in Lordstown, Trumbull 
Co. </p>
<p>Fannie Doud married <a href="7.htm">John Lewis</a> who was born c.1796 in Vermont. They were 
probably married in Preston or Oxford, NY<sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup>. John 
and Fannie <a href="7.htm">Lewis</a> bought land in section 14 of Bath Township, Allen Co., OH on 15 
Sep 1835. This land was across the road from the land bought by <a href="3.htm">Samuel Bassitt</a> 
in 1834 and next to the land purchased in 1836 by <a href="7.htm">Jonathan Lewis</a> who is believed 
to have been <a href="3.htm">Elsie (Lewis) Bassitt</a>'s brother (and wife of Samuel). It is 
believed that <a href="7.htm">John Lewis</a> was also the brother of Elsie. 
<a href="p.htm">Frank P. Edgecomb</a> states 
that his father, <a href="p.htm">Phineas</a> &quot;took land that was taken up by 
<a href="7.htm">John Lewis</a> who came 
with the <a href="2.htm">Edgecombs</a>&quot;<sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup>. This insinuates that John 
and Fanny lived in Allen County at some time, but census records show them 
living in Lordstown, Trumbull County in 1830 and 1840 and in Warren in 1850. 
They were in Warren, OH when they sold their land to <a href="p.htm">Phineas</a> in 1842, so if they 
ever lived in Allen County, it must have been only briefly. John died in 1873 in 
Warren, OH.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their daughter, Cynthia married <a href="everett.htm">
Nathan Everett, Jr.</a></p>
<p>Chloe Doud married George Olmstead (who was born 10 Nov 1797<sup><a href="#23">23</a></sup>) 
in Warren, Trumbull Co., OH on 22 Aug 1822<sup><a href="#24">24</a></sup>. Their 
children were:<sup><a href="#25">25</a></sup></p>

<p>Chloe and George came to Bath Twp., Allen County, OH in about 1834.<sup><a href="#28">28</a></sup> 
George died on 19 Aug 1845 and their younger children lived with older siblings. 
In 1850, Steven and Emeline were living with their sister Esther Everett and 
Jesse and Olive were living with their oldest sister, Mary Allison. George O. 
was shown living on his own next to the Allisons.<sup><a href="#29">29</a></sup> 
However, George Olmstead, age 20, was also reported as living with Alva Doud, 
Jr. in Newton Twp., Trumbull Co., OH on the census there.<sup><a href="#30">30</a></sup> 
Chloe later married a Mowen. </p>

Eagleton in 1981, when she wrote to Steve Bassett (Baskauf) giving the quoted 
excerpts. (The diary was in the possession of Bob Claussen in 2009.) 
However, excerpts from the diary were used as proof of descendency by several 
members of the DAR, so photocopies of parts of the diary may exist in DAR 
records. <a href="images/notes/459.gif">On page 1</a>, Davis Doud writes &quot;Dec. 30, 1902. In this book I will write
