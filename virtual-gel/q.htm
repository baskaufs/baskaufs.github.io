<p>Little is known about John Edgecomb, the son of <a href="4.htm">Uriah Edgecomb</a> (b. 1740).<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>&nbsp; 
His birth was said to be after 1760.&nbsp;  John is listed as a &quot;soldier of the 
Revolution&quot;<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>&nbsp; as he applied for a pension 
in Paris Twp, Portage Co., OH in 1831<sup><a href="#2a">2a</a></sup>.&nbsp; 
(This is the location where his brother <a href="2.htm">Uriah</a> lived in 
1820.)&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
<p>In 1794 John was given land in New Hartford and Simsbury, CT, by his father.<sup><a href="#2a">2a</a></sup>&nbsp; 
About the same time, he married Elizabeth Olmstead, b. c.1775 and daughter of Roger and Eunice Olmstead.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>&nbsp; 
It is not known if they were related to George Olmstead who married 
<a href="5.htm">Chloe Doud</a>, 
sister of John's sister-in-law, <a href="2.htm">Betsy Doud Edgecomb</a>.&nbsp; 
If this information is true, then John would have been much older than his wife.</p>
<p>John had one known son, <a href="p.htm">Phineas</a>, who was born 5 Sep 1795<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> in Canton, Hartford Co., Connecticut.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> 
and died 14 Mar 1881 in Bath Twp., Allen Co., OH.&nbsp; Elizabeth died on 17 Nov 
1801 at the age of 26, when Phineas was six years old. John's application for a 
pension occurred in Ohio, so he may have moved there late in life.&nbsp; </p>
