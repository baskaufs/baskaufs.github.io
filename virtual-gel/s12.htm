<p>Jacob Sharpenstein and Maria Bush were married on 6 Dec 1741 in the Fishkill 
Reformed Church, New York.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>&nbsp; They had the children:</p>

<p>Jacob lived in Crum Elbow in 1743 and was naturalized 20 Dec 1763.&nbsp; 
During the Revolutionary War he was a loyalist as were some of his children who 
later emigrated to Canada.<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Jacob and several of his children were listed in the 1790 census under 
Washington, Dutchess Co., NY.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>&nbsp; Also listed in 
Jacob's household were two slaves.&nbsp; Slaves were imported by the Dutch West 
India company when the Dutch were in control of New Amsterdam (later New York) 
and the use of slaves continued until 1827.&nbsp; Although the number of slaves 
in New York was much lower than in the south, New York city was a major port for 
importing slaves and a major slave market.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Jacob died before 15 Oct 1802.<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><a name="1790-census"></a><b>Rationalization of the 1790 census</b></p>
<p>The 1790 census<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> for Washington, Dutchess County, 
NY contains the names of a number of Sharpstones and related families.&nbsp; I 
will attempt here to place each of them by comparing them with the Sharpsteens 
listed in Anderson (2006).<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
<p><img border="0" src="census/1790-ny-dutchess-washington-150-crop.jpg" width="506" height="356"></p>
<p>The census lists a <b>Henry Bush</b> with two males over 16, 3 males under 
16, and 3 females.&nbsp; There are two Henry Bush's listed in Anderson (2006): 
the family patriarch, Johann Herich Bush b. 1701 in Germany, and his son Henry 
b. 1743.&nbsp; However, as a loyalist the son moved to Ulster Co., NY in 1771 
and died in about 1777.&nbsp; So the Henry Bush listed in the census is probably 
the elder Henry, who would have been aged 89.&nbsp; The elder Henry's will was 
probated in Jan 1791 in Dutchess Co., so he was likely to have been living there 
in 1790.&nbsp; It is not clear who the other four males and three females are - 
probably one of his children and child's family.</p>
<p><b>Jacob Sharpsteen</b> b. c.1716 who married Maria Bush was an immigrant 
from Germany.&nbsp; Anderson (2006) does not list siblings who emigrated and the 
other Sharpstones listed in this census can all be accounted for as members of 
his family.&nbsp; So I am considering Jacob as the ancestor of all of the 
Sharpsteens listed here.&nbsp; He has no listed descendants born before 1790 and 
died &quot;before 15 Oct 1802&quot;, so I'm assuming that Jacob b. c.1716 is the Jacob 
Sharpstone listed here.&nbsp; His household contained two males over 16 (Jacob 
aged 74 and another male), no males under 16, and one female (Maria? aged 66).&nbsp; 
The lack of younger males supports the idea that this was an elderly couple.&nbsp; 
Two slaves were listed in the household.</p>
<p><b>George Cusack<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></b> was the household listed before Henry Bush.&nbsp; He 
would be the husband of Molly Sharpsteen, daughter of Jacob and Maria Bush 
Sharpsteen (the daughter of Henry Bush).&nbsp; The household is listed as having 
one male over 16 (George aged about 40), five males under 16 (James H. aged 16, 
William aged 11, Robert aged 4, John aged 2, and Peter? aged 0), and 2 females 
(Molly aged about 39 and possibly one of the girls said to have died young?).&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Henry Sharpsteen</b> b. c.1743 and son of Jacob and Maria Bush Sharpsteen 
is the only Henry Sharpsteen listed in Anderson (2006).&nbsp; The household of 
Henry Sharpstone included four males over 16 (Henry aged 48, his son Peter aged 
19, probably Henry's son John H. aged 24 [see commentary below], and another 
male [possibly another son not listed??]), one male under 16 (perhaps another 
son not listed??), and eight females (Henry's wife Phoebe aged 46, John H.'s 
wife Jane aged 24, John H.'s daughters Mary aged 3 and Phoebe aged 1, and four 
other females unaccounted for).&nbsp; One slave was listed in the household.</p>
<p><b>Peter Sharpsteen </b>b. 1757 and son of Jacob and Maria Bush Sharpsteen is 
likely the Peter Sharpstone listed in the census.&nbsp; The other Peter that 
would be possible is Henry's son, Peter, but in 1790 he was 19 and unmarried and 
therefore would have been unlikely to have been listed as the head of this 
household.&nbsp; The household contained one male over 16 (Peter aged 33), two 
males under 16 [possibly sons not listed in Anderson (2006)??], and one female 
(Peter's wife Deborah aged 23, however where is their daughter Anna aged 3?).&nbsp; 
So there is not a very exact concordance between the family members listed in 
Anderson (2006) and the household, but there are no other likely Peters that 
this could be.</p>
<p>&quot;<b>John Sharpstone</b>&quot; could either be John Sharpsteen b. 1762 and son of 
Jacob and Maria Bush Sharpsteen, or John H. Sharpsteen b. 1766 and son of Henry 
and Phoebe Losee Sharpsteen.&nbsp; However, for several reasons I believe that 
it is probably John b. 1762.&nbsp; First of all the John b. 1762 needs to be 
accounted for.&nbsp; According to Anderson (2006) his children were being born 
over the period of 1786-1800 but unfortunately their birthplaces were not given, 
so I don't know that he was in Dutchess Co. at that time.&nbsp; I do not favor 
this &quot;John Sharpstone&quot; as being John H. b.1766 for two reasons.&nbsp; One is 
that he and his family can be accounted for in the household of Henry (see 
above).&nbsp; The other is that in the
<a href="census/1800-ny-columbia-livingston-293.jpg">1800</a> and
<a href="census/1810-ny-columbia-gallatin-838.jpg">1810</a> censuses, John is 
pointedly listed as &quot;John H. Sharpstone&quot; with the &quot;H.&quot; presumably used to 
differentiate him from his uncle.&nbsp; If this household were John b. 1762, 
then the one male over 16 would be John aged 28, the male under 16 would be 
Stephen aged 2, and the four females would be John's wife Rachel aged 27, their 
daughter Catherine aged 4 and two other unidentified females.</p>
