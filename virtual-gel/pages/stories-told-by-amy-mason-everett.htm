<p>Because we were born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio, away from Allen County 
and the relatives there, my brothers and I were fascinated by our mother's 
stories of her family and childhood growing up on the farm in Bath Township as 
the youngest child of Amy Louisa (Edgecomb/Snyder) and Marquis D. Mason.&nbsp; 
At various times, we heard about a superstition, a fatal accident, murder, 
pranks by siblings, and even a snake bite.</p>

<p>One evening in 1895, a family was visiting the Mason home in Bath Township.&nbsp; 
The children, playing in a separate room, heard a loud moaning cry coming from 
the darkness outside the window.&nbsp; Someone thought it was a banshee, the 
Irish superstition forecasting a death.&nbsp; Probably, it was some of the older 
Mason boys trying to scare the younger kids.&nbsp; But, coincidentally, the next 
day my mother's brother, FRANK MASON, was driving a steam-driven tractor 
belonging to his uncle when the bridge he was crossing caved in.&nbsp; The 
wrecked tractor's steering wheel crushed his chest and arm.&nbsp; My mother 
said, &quot;they had to amputate his arm there in our downstairs room.&nbsp; He 
begged them not to do it.&nbsp; You could hear his screams.&nbsp; I was five 
years old.&nbsp; He called me Kitten.&nbsp; He died the next day.&quot;</p>

<p>One year on Halloween, Mom's brothers, Don, Charles, and Harry Mason, took 
their Uncle Phil Roush's buggy apart and hauled it up to the roof of his barn 
and reassembled it.&nbsp; Harry was the ring-leader.&nbsp; Uncle Phil was 
furious, which added to the boys' great glee!</p>

<p>In 1904, the dead bodies of ELMER MASON, 36, the son of Marquis and Amy 
Louisa (Snyder) Mason, and his friend Rolla McDorman, age 27, were found at 8 
A.M. by the railroad tracks 4 miles from the Mason farm.&nbsp; The men had last 
been seen about 2:30 A.M. on their way home from Lima and quite sober.&nbsp; The 
sheriff theorized that they had fallen asleep sitting on the railroad tracks and 
were hit by a train.&nbsp; Both had broken necks and identical fractured skulls.&nbsp; 
Although Elmer was in the habit of carrying a considerable amount of money, the 
men had 42 cents between them.&nbsp; My mother, Elmer's sister, said the family 
discovered the leather layers in the heels of both men were separated by fine 
pieces of sand and gravel embedded between them.&nbsp; It was apparent both had 
been dragged for some distance.&nbsp; The Mason family, angry with the poor 
policework, strongly suspected an advance man of the coming circus, a mean and 
low character.&nbsp; Nothing was ever found or proven.&nbsp;

<p>It is interesting how family stories are passed down through the generations 
- for instance, Clarinda Edgecomb Snyder and the snake bite.&nbsp; As our 
mother, Amy Mason Everett, related how her mother (Amy Louisa Mason) explained 
the incident: &quot;Mom said that her mother (Clarinda Edgecomb Snyder) was milking 
near the barn and she was bitten on her foot by a rattle snake.&nbsp; The boys 
were told to run to the spring house and bring down buckets of milk.&nbsp; Her 
foot was plunged into a bucket and the milk drew out the poison, causing the 
milk to curdle.&nbsp; This was repeated over and over again.&nbsp; It saved her 
life.&quot; <sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></p>

Wilbur L. and Amy (Mason) Everett, April 1914<sup><a href="#3a">3a</a></sup></p>

<p>On August 21, 1950, our mother, Amy Mason Everett, with her brother, Donald 
and his wife, Margaret, visited the farm site in Shawnee Township<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> where Peter 
and Clarinda Snyder lived 1856-1862.&nbsp; On one of two pictures taken that 
day, she wrote:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="../images/00/barn-web.jpg" width="644" height="432"></p>

<p>&nbsp;&quot;Little stream here where my grandmother got rattle snake bite.&nbsp; 
Same barn.&nbsp; Breese Farm - Shawnee Township.&quot;&nbsp; On the second 
picture she wrote: </p>

<p><img border="0" src="../images/00/house-web.jpg" width="640" height="432"></p>

<p>&quot;Old milk house on Mom's home farm.&nbsp; 
The milk house as it was when she lived here.&quot;&nbsp; In as much as Peter and 
Clarinda Snyder sold out the farm in Shawnee Township in 1862 and moved back to 
Bath Township, Clarinda's snake bite happened between 1856 and 1862.&nbsp; It 
was not fatal<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>; Clarinda died 19 December 1866.</p>

This picture &quot;is the one of Marquis Mason in his Union uniform.&nbsp; It is from a 
tin type photo given to my Aunt Earlene when my grandfather died.&nbsp; You can see 
his sniper rifle in the photo but the background is probably fake.&nbsp; He is 
sitting on a milk crate.&nbsp; We are not sure when or where this photo was taken.&nbsp; 
Notice there are no markings on his uniform to identify his rank or unit.&nbsp; This 
was common for snipers because if they were caught by the enemy, they would not 
be able to tell what division they were from and rank.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My grandfather [Franklin Earl &quot;Skeet&quot; Roeder] used to tell 
us stories that M.D. Mason used to tell him as a kid when they sat on the porch 
swing at the family farm.&nbsp; M.D. Mason was a sniper in the 81st division Ohio 
Union Infantry from August 30, 1861 to September 26, 1864.&nbsp; One story I remember 
is that he was in the battle above the clouds otherwise known as the battle of 
Chattanooga.&nbsp; Confederates were raining artillery down on the Union positions in 
the valley.&nbsp; His assignment was to go up into the hills and take out any 
artillery leaders he could find.&nbsp; The idea being that there was usually one 
leader and the rest of the artillery unit were kids.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you killed the 
leader, the kids would run.&nbsp; He never told us if he was successful in getting 
any leaders that day.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another story he told us was about when M.D. Mason caught 
camp fever and was hospitalized in Corinth Mississippi during Sherman’s march to 
the sea.&nbsp; He was extremely ill and camp fever supposedly killed as many troops 
as combat.&nbsp; Camp fever was a disease similar to scurvy.&nbsp; In order to save his 
life, his buddies set off one night to try and find a live cow in order to get 
fresh cow’s milk.&nbsp; Fresh cow’s milk was the only cure they knew for camp fever.&nbsp; 
There were few livestock alive because the Confederates had killed most of them 
as they retreated in order to keep the Union soldiers from getting them.&nbsp; His 
buddies set off one night against orders and were successful in finding a cow 
and bringing it back to milk it, probably saving his life.&nbsp; This story may seem 
insignificant to some but when you consider the fact that the entire family tree 
you documented might have never existed, we have some very brave young soldiers 
to thank for an act of courage that was performed against orders.&quot;<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup></p>
