<p>Your Melvin DeLong's father, Augustus DeLong is the brother to my Josiah 
DeLong (abt June 1869) </p>
<p>I realize that this message you posted was dated 2000 and you probably have 
got more info since then. I would like to share what I have found. </p>
<p>I will post my message in several parts because it's too long to fit here.
</p>
<p>Descendants of Josiah DeLong </p>
<p>Generation No. 1 </p>
<p>1. Josiah1 DeLong was born Bet. 1804 - 1806 in PA or OH and died Bet. Jul 
1870 - 1880. He married Marilla &quot;Mariah&quot; Edgecomb Bet. 1830 - 1832 in possibly 
Allen Co., OH, daughter of Uriah Edgecomb and Elizabeth Doud. She was born Bet. 
1812 - 1813 in NY or Ct, and died Bet. Jul 1870 - 1880. </p>
<p>Josiah DeLong listed in 1840 Lima Township, Allen Co., OH/ 1850 Vandenburgh 
Co., IND/ 1860 Patoka, Gibson Co., IND/ 1870 Johnson, Gibson Co., IND </p>
<p>Children of Josiah DeLong and Marilla Edgecomb are: 2 i. William A.2 DeLong, 
born Bet. 1832 - 1833 in PA/ 1850 Pigeon Township Dellison E, Vandenburgh Co., 
Ind. Census/ 1860 Patoka, Gibson Co., Ind.; died Aft. 1860. 3 ii. Elizabeth 
DeLong, born Abt. 1835 in OH. + 4 iii. Augustus DeLong, born Abt. 1837 in OH. 5 
iv. Hester DeLong, born Abt. 1840 in OH. + 6 v. Samuel DeLong, born Abt. 1835 in 
OH / 1870 Johnson, Gibson Co., Ind Census / 1880 Fort Branch, Gibson Co., Ind 
Census / Father born- PA &amp; Mother born -Ohio; died 23 Aug 1907 in Ft. Branch, 
Gibson Co., IN. </p>
<p>Please note, Bath township is located on the East side of the city of Lima, 
in Allen Co., OH. Under the 1840 Census, Uriah &amp; Ezra Edgecomb ae listed in the 
town of Bath. </p>
<p>Then in the Lima township is listed Josiah DeLong. When you look at the page 
Josiah is mentioned on, pg 125, on the left side edge you‚Äôll see it says Lima 
Township-Bath Township. </p>
<p>So the census taker continued his documentations of the homes close by. So 
Josiah DeLong was living in the part of Lima that would have been very close to 
Bath. </p>
<p>For census info, see below for Josiah DeLong and further down for Uriah 
Edgecomb. </p>
<p>Generation No. 2 </p>
<p>4. Augustus2 DeLong (Josiah1) was born Abt. 1837 in OH. </p>
<p>Note: Not sure if this is correct- I don‚Äôt know that Augustus DeLong (b. 
abt 1837, OH) was the father of Matthew Augustus DeLong. Since a Josiah DeLong, 
mustered in Oct 1861, under the 42nd regiment, company A. of Indiana, is 
unaccounted for, Mathew Augustus DeLong may be this Josiah‚Äôs son, since he is 
living with his grandparents in 1870. I haven‚Äôt got access to an index of the 
1860 Indiana Census for DeLong. So if anyone has access to it, please send me a 
copy. I‚Äôd really appreciate that. </p>

Indiana/ 1870 Johnson, Gibson Co., Indiana -with paternal Grandparents. </p>

Ft. Branch, Gibson Co., IN. He married (1) Mary Jane Lamphar 02 May 1868 in 
Gibson Co., Indiana , book #3, pg 462- 2nd husband. She was born Bet. 1843 - 
1844 in Gibson Co., IN, and died Bet. 1885 - 1891 in Ft. Branch, Gibson Co., IN. 
He married (2) Lucinda Jones 17 Oct 1889 in Gibson Co., Indiana. She was born 
Sep 1865. </p>

<p>Samuel Delong was married 2 times.1st wife- Mary Jane (Lamphar) Jones. This 
is where my line is. </p>
<p>2nd wife-Lucinda Jones they had 4 children that I know of 1.Luther b 1891 
2.Samuel b 1893 3.McCinley ? b 1896 4.John b 1900. </p>
<p>I know nothing on these 4 children. Maybe this is where your Helen Delong 
comes in as one of their children? I have a Helen Delong (1918-1992) in my line 
she was married to Edgar Lynch and is buried in Walnut Hill Cemetary,Ft.Branch, 
In. Don't know if any of this helped. </p>

<p>Ana, </p>
<p>Attached is Josiah DeLong's obituary. I looked for an obit for Martha DeLong 
but could not find anything. I also checked the Walnut Hill Cemetery 
transcription but did not find anything for Helen Myers. There was a Helen E.L. 
Meyer (1913-1989) listed but the birth and death dates did not match up. The 
next time I am in the Gibson County Health Dept. I will check to see if I can 
find a death record for Martha which should provide some additional information.
</p>
<p>I checked the Gibson County Marriage Index and found the marriage of Josiah 
DeLong and Martha E. Hughes on 6/1/1890. The following is the information I 
obtained from a transcription of their marriage application: </p>
<p>Record #1808 - Pages 290/291 </p>
<p>DeLong, Joshiah Age: 21y 1st Marriage Birthplace: Ft. Branch Occupation: 
Publisher Father: Sam'l DeLong Mother: Mary J. Lausphear (Note: Mary Jane 
Lausphear‚Äôs last name is listed above as Lamphar ‚Äì Need to find out which is 
correct) Hughes, Martha E. Age: 24y 1st Marriage Birthplace: Cynthiana Father: 
Jas. Hughes Mother: Eliz. Duckworth </p>
<p>Marriage Date: 01 June 1890 </p>
<p>I made a copy of the Walnut Hill Cemetery burial records index for DeLong's 
which gives the name, age at death, Lot/Section number, date of burial and 
relationship information. </p>
<p>Josiah and Martha DeLong are buried in Lot/Section 162. According to the 
burial records, there is also in Lot/Section 162, an Infant buried on 11 Mar 
1905 and Melvin DeLong, age 66, buried on 15 July 1977. </p>
<p>According to Browning's Obituary site (http://browning.evcpl.lib.in.us/), 
Melvin died on 7/12/1977. </p>
<p>There is a Samuel DeLong listed in the burial records, although there is no 
other information given except that he is buried in Lot/Section 240. The only 
other listing for a burial in Lot/Section 240 is a listing for a child of Samuel 
DeLong but it does not give an age or date of burial. </p>
<p>I hope some of this information helps. I will see what else I can find and 
will get back with you. </p>
<p>Georgia -----------------------Obit of Josiah Delong to follow 
below----------------------------------------------- </p>
<p>(Sent on 10 Mar 2004 from Georgia McEllhiney to Ana Montero-Smith) </p>
<p>Published in: Gibson Co., Indiana Newspaper: Princeton Clarion Date of 
Newpaper: 11 July 1927 </p>
<p>Obit: Josiah DeLong </p>
<p>Josiah Delong, a printer employed at the Cockrum Printing Company at Oakland 
City, died at 10 o‚Äôclock Sunday morning at the hospital here, following a 
three weeks‚Äô illness of typhoid fever. He was 57 years old. The funeral will 
be held at 2:30 o‚Äôclock Tuesday afternoon at the Baptist church in Ft. Branch, 
his former home. Burial will be in Walnut Hill cemetery. The body was removed to 
the home of a brother, William Delong, at Ft. Branch. Mr. Delong is survived by 
his wife and two grown children. Several relatives live in Ft. Branch. He and 
his wife had lived in Oakland City for several years. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
So according to this obit, it appears Lois Elva (DeLong) Williams, died before 
her father died. (Lois did show up in the 1920 census but her husband, Edward 
Williams, is a widow by 1930, see above). </p>
<p>That left 1. Helen (DeLong) Myers &amp; 2. Carlos DeLong as the two grown 
children mentioned in the obit. Helen was my line and she had a daughter, Anna 
Jean Myers, in 1934. </p>
<p>If anyone wants a scanned copy of the original obit, please write or e-mail

<p>Source: Allen Co., Ohio Genealogy website mention of Uriah Edgecomb, and his 
son Ezara Edgecomb under the section of ‚ÄúEarly Allen Co. Settlers‚Äù Permanent 
Settlers of the Pioneer Period </p>
<p>Please note, Bath township is located on the East side of the city of Lima, 
in Allen Co., OH. Under the 1840 Census, Uriah &amp; Ezra Edgecomb ae listed in the 
town of Bath. </p>
<p>Then in the Lima township is listed Josiah DeLong. When you look at the page 
Josiah is mentioned on, pg 125, on the left side edge you‚Äôll see it says Lima 
Township-Bath Township. </p>
<p>So the census taker continued his documentations of the homes close by. So 
Josiah DeLong was living in the part of Lima that would have been very close to 
Bath. </p>
