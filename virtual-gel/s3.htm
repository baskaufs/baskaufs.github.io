<p>John H. Sharpsteen and Jane Simpson were probably married in about 1786<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> 
in eastern New York.&nbsp; In 1790, they were probably living in Washington, Dutchess 
Co., NY.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>&nbsp; In family references, they are 
referred to as &quot;Sharpsteen&quot;.&nbsp; However, on the <a href="#2">1800-1810 census 
records</a>, they are listed under &quot;Sharpstone&quot;, which is a literal translation 
of the German &quot;Scharffenstein&quot;.&nbsp; </p>

<p>They had the following children:<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="1.htm">Mary 13 Nov 1787 - 11 May 1853, m. Philip Snyder, Jr.</a><br>
Phoebe&nbsp; 22 Aug 1789 - 11 Feb 1838, m. Robert Callister on 1 Jan 1806.<br>
Elizabeth &quot;Betsy&quot;&nbsp; 31 May 1791 - May 1863 <br>
Sarah&nbsp; 15 Nov 1792 - 8 Jan 1863, m. John Pulver<br>
John 17 Feb 1794 - 20 Feb 1863 at Chatham Corners, m. Susan Smith on 2 Feb 1813<br>
Samuel&nbsp; 8 Apr 1796 - 25 Nov 1865 in Perry, Wyoming Co., New York, m. 
Margaret Sleight<br>
Rebecca&nbsp; b. 3 Jun 1798-27 Feb [?], m. Elias D. Haight on 30 Sep 1818 in 
Washington Hollow.&nbsp; <br>
Eliza Ann&nbsp; 6 Aug 1800 - after 1860 in Hillsdale, Michigan, m. Ira Warren<br>
Margaret&nbsp; b. 22 Feb 1803<br>
Jane&nbsp; b. 20 Apr 1808</p>

<p>The census records from 1800-1810 generally support these names and dates<sup><a href="#3">3</a> <a href="#4">4</a></sup>, although they suggest that there 
may have been one son and two daughters older than Mary.&nbsp; If this were 
true, then the marriage date of John and Jane would be pushed back to as early 
as 1763 when they were 17 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>By 1800, John and his family had moved up the Hudson River valley to Columbia 
County where they were living in the town of Livingston.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>&nbsp; 
By 1810, they were living in the town of Gallatin.&nbsp; The census record shows 
Mary and her husband, <a href="1.htm">Philip Snyder, Jr.</a>, living nearby.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>&nbsp; 
In 1820 John's family is back in Washington, Dutchess Co., NY.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>&nbsp; 
In 1830, John Sharpsteen and his family are living in Leicester, Ontario Co., 
NY.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>&nbsp; They are living near to Henry Snider who 
is probably his grandson, son of Mary Snyder.&nbsp; Also listed nearby is Ira 
Warren, husband of Eliza Ann.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Jane died on 9 Jan 1840 and John is recorded as dying in Leicester, 
Livingston Co., NY on 25 Oct 1848,<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> suggesting that 
the Sharpsteen family and Philip Snyder, Jr.'s family moved west together 
through New York and on to Michigan.&nbsp; (Livingston Co. is just west of Ontario County where 
Philip moved in about 1815.)&nbsp; This is supported by the fact that Samuel is 
listed in the 1840 census for Leicester, Livingston County, NY<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> 
and 
descendants of Samuel and Eliza Ann died in Michigan where <a href="s.htm">Mary 
and some of her children</a> moved after they lived in western New York.&nbsp; </p>

our family and the origins of John Sharpsteen and Jane Simpson Sharpsteen and to 
Barry Coomer who pointed out that Sharpsteen was rendered Sharpstone in early 
records.</font></p>
