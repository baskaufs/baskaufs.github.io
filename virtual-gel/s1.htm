<p>It is not known definitively what the relationship is between the Peter
Snyder (b. c.1793) and our branch of the family.&nbsp; However, based on
circumstantial evidence, it is possible that he was a child of <a href="s2.htm">
Philip Snyder, Sr.</a> and hence brother to <a href="1.htm">Phillip, Jr.</a> and
uncle to <a href="g.htm">Peter (b.1820)</a> and <a href="s.htm">Lorenzo (b.
1809)</a>.&nbsp; Another possibility is that he was a close cousin to Phillip,
Jr.&nbsp; The following information below outlines what is known about him and
the evidence that suggest his relationship with our Snyder family.&nbsp; It is
relatively clear that Betsy Lewis Snyder is a part of the <a href="7.htm">Lewis
family</a> that is closely intertwined with the <a href="3.htm">Bassetts</a> and
<a href="2.htm">Edgecombs</a>.</p>

<p>Based on the information in the 1850 census, Peter Snyder was born in about
1793 in New York.&nbsp; (This contrasts with the birth year of 1790 given in
Arthur G. Lyon's letter<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.)  Assiming that the gravestone of Peter Snyder in
the old Angola Cemetery, Steuben County, IN is his grave, his birth date would be about 28 Feb 1791. (There is
some uncertainty depending on how one subtracts the years, months, and days from the death date on the stone.) <sup><a href="#26">26</a></sup>
Elizabeth (Betsy or
Betsey) was born in about 1795<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. Based on the ages
of their children (see below) and a marriage date of 18 years for Betsy, Peter
and Betsy were probably married in about 1813-14.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The following list of children is compiled from the 1850 census and the Lyon
letter (compare also the <a href="#1840census">1840 census</a>) with the
exception of Rosetta who is inferred based on circumstantial evidence to be
discussed below.<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup>&nbsp; The dates

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Problems with early connections</b></p>

<p>One problem with the hypothesis that Peter Snyder (b. c.1793) was a relative
to Peter Snyder (b. 1820) is reconciling how the elder Peter ended up crossing
paths with Betsy Lewis.&nbsp; Around the time when Peter and Betsy were married
(c.1815), the <a href="7.htm">Lewis family</a> was living in either Otsego or
Cortland Co., NY.&nbsp; At that time, <a href="s2.htm">Philip Snyder</a> (father
of Peter b.1820) was moving from Columbia Co., NY to Ontario Co., NY.&nbsp;
Neither Ontario nor Columbia Counties are near Otsego or Cortland Counties, so
it is not clear how the Snyder and Lewis families would have encountered each
other.&nbsp; It is possible that in a move west in about 1815, the Snyders may
have passed through Otsego or Cortland Counties and Peter (b. c.1793) could have
met Betsy then.&nbsp; Betsy might then have traveled west to Ontario County with
Peter or Peter might have stayed with Betsy.&nbsp; </p>

<p>There are two pieces of information relevant to this question.&nbsp; One is
that a Peter Snyder was said to have come to Candice, Ontario Co., NY along with
Philip (presumably &quot;our&quot; Philip) in 1815.<sup><a href="#2">2</a> <a href="#3">3</a></sup>.&nbsp;
In the 1820 census for Richmond Twp., Ontario Co., NY, there is a Peter Snyder
listed immediately after a Philip (presumably &quot;our&quot; Philip).<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>&nbsp;
Comparison with the list of the children of Peter (b. c.1793) shows possible
correspondence with this census record:</p>

<p>Peter Snider - Males: one under 10 (Cicero?), one 18 to 26, one 26 to 45
(Peter age 27), one over 45 (older male); females: two under 10 (dau. 1 &amp; 2),
one 16-24 (Betsy about 25), 1 over 45 (older female)</p>

<p>However, since the usual practice is for the oldest male to be listed as head
of household, the male over age 45 would be the most likely person to be &quot;Peter
Snider&quot; rather than Peter b. c.1793.&nbsp; If the &quot;over 45 male&quot; was the father
of Peter (b. c.1793), this record is not compatible with Peter (b. c.1793) being
a brother of Philip Snyder, Jr. (whose father was Philip Snyder, Sr.).&nbsp; In
the <a href="http://raims.com/DeedsSMSN.html">index of early land transactions
of Ontario County</a>, Peter Snider bought land from Thomas Morris in 1798 (liber=book
5, page 414; the second reference to Peter Snider listed under 1748 was
confirmed to be an error and actually referring to the same record where the
spelling was &quot;Snider&quot;).&nbsp; Given that the Peter
Snyder who is the subject of this account would have been too young (or not
born) to make these purchases, this purchaser was probably the elder Peter
Snyder who was over the age of 45 in 1820.&nbsp; If this is the elder Peter
Snyder who did not arrive in Ontario County until 1815 with Philip, then he must
have purchased the land before moving there.</p>

<p>The other relevant piece of information is that according to the Trumbull
County history<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>, there were very few settlers in
Lordstown Twp. before 1826.&nbsp; That year, Peleg Lewis, John Lewis, Samuel
Bassett, and Peter Snyder were reported as living there, suggesting that they
all moved there about that year.&nbsp; If this were the case, then it suggests
that Peter Snyder moved to Trumbull Co., with Samuel Bassett and the Lewis's,
who were coming from Solon, Courtland Co., NY.&nbsp; That scenario would suggest
that either Peter (b. c.1793) was related to Philip and joined up with the
Lewis's in Otsego/Cortland Co. or that he simply was from a different Snyder
family altogether and not a relative of Peter (b. 1820).&nbsp; However, this
would then raise the question of how Lorenzo Snyder came to move to Trumbull Co.
in about 1832.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Known track of Peter and Betsy</b></p>

<p>In 1826, Peter and Betsy lived &quot;north of the center&quot; of Lordstown Twp.,
Trumbull Co., OH.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>On 7 January 1828 Peter Snyder was elected Justice of the Peace. <sup>
<a href="#17">17</a></sup>&nbsp; On 16 August 1832, he married William
Richardson and Rosetta Snyder who was probably his daughter.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In 1830, Peter and his family are listed in the <a href="#1830census">census for Lordstown
Twp</a>.</p>

<p>In September 1835, Peter and Betsy Snyder
bought land in section 11, to the north of Lorenzo (and diagonally northwest of <a href="3.htm">Samuel Bassett</a>).
(See the <a href="images/1830s.gif">plat map of northern Bath Township, Allen
Co., OH</a>.)&nbsp; They were described as &quot;of Trumbull
County, Ohio&quot; so at that time they were not yet living in Allen County.<a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a> In 1839, Peter and Betsey sold land
to their son Cicero for one dollar.<a href="#9"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp; In that
transaction, they were described as &quot;of Bath, county of Allen&quot; so they were
living on their land in Bath at the time that the younger Peter (b. 1820) moved
there.&nbsp; On the same day, Peter and Betsey sold an adjacent part of their
land to William Richardson.<sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup>&nbsp; In the sale to
Cicero, William Richardson was a witness and in the sale to William Richardson,
Cicero was a witness.&nbsp; Both sales were witnessed by the same justice of the
peace.&nbsp; By 16 Dec 1839, Peter, Betsey, and Cisero were again living in
Lordstown, Trumbull Co.<a href="#10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>Because Betsy is not listed in the 1850 census, she had presumably died by
that time.&nbsp; A Peter Snyder of Milton Twp., Mahoning Co., OH (adjacent to
Newton Twp of Trumbull Co) married <a href="5.htm">Lydia Doud Brown</a> (sister
of <a href="2.htm">Betsy Doud Edgecomb</a>) on 26 Jun 1851.<a href="#7"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;
However, it is not known if this the Peter b. c.1793.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In 1860, the census has Peter (aged 69) living in Pleasant Twp., Steuben Co.,
Indiana with his daughter Alzina, aged 35.&nbsp; If the grave in the old Angola Cemetery is his,
Peter died on 26 May 1864.<sup><a href="#26">26</a></sup>  Also living in Pleasant
Township are Ambrose and Mary Snyder, Rosetta and William Richardson in 1850,
1860,1870 and 1880, and Cicero and Rachel Snyder in 1860 and 1870.</p>

<p><b>Parentage of Betsy Snyder</b></p>

<p>Assuming that Mr. Lyon was correct in giving Lewis as Betsy's maiden name,
there are two pieces of circumstantial evidence that strongly support the
conjecture that Betsy was a daughter of <a href="7.htm">Peleg Lewis</a>, sister
to Jonathan and John Lewis shown on the plat map, and sister to Elsie Lewis
Bassitt, wife of <a href="3.htm">Samuel Bassitt</a> also shown on the map. The
first is the date of purchase of Peter and Betsy's land in section 11<a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a>.
This date, 15 Sep 1835 is the same as the date John and Fanny Lewis bought their
adjacent land in section 14. Both Peter and Betsy and John and Fanny were
residents of Lordstown Twp., Trumbull Co., OH when they made their purchases.
Therefore it is very suggestive that these purchases were the coordinated effort
of siblings. </p>

<p>The other evidence is the account of the formation of the first church (later
to be a part of the Disciples of Christ denomination) in Lordstown Twp. on 20
Mar 1830<a href="#8"><sup>8</sup></a>. The church was organized in a log cabin
school house on the corner of the farm of David Lewis (another child of Peleg
Lewis). Original members included Samuel Bassett and wife, Peleg, Fanny, and
Rachel Lewis, David Lewis and wife, Sylvester Roberts and wife, Peter Snyder and
wife, and Betsy Snyder. It is believed that all of these Lewis' as well as
Samuel Bassitt's wife, Elsie, and Sylvester Roberts' wife, Mary, were siblings.
If the inferences made in this posting are correct, then Peter Snyder's wife,
Betsy was a sibling as well. I do not know why in the list of original members
the wife of Peter Snyder and Betsy Snyder are listed separately. Perhaps there
were two Betsy Snyders. </p>

<p>In a transaction dated 1 Mar 1840, Joseph and Maria Lewis of Lordstown Twp.,
Trumbull Co., OH sold land in section 1 of Bath Twp. to Martin Lewis of Putnam
Co., OH (which at that time was adjacent to section 1 of Bath Twp. although
after the reorganization of 1848 Monroe Township was transferred from Putnam to
Allen County). This transaction was witnessed by Peter and Alzina Snyder. I do
not know who Joseph Lewis is, although it is thought that Martin Lewis was the
son of Peleg Lewis, Jr., oldest sibling of John, Jonathan, Elsie, etc. This
again shows that Peter (b. 1793) and his family were closely associated with the
Lewis's. </p>

<p><b>Tangled web of relationships among early landowners in northeastern Bath
Township, Allen Co., OH</b></p>

<p>Returning to the <a href="images/1830s.gif">plat map of northeastern Bath
Township</a>, the relationships among the landowners listed are as follows:
<a href="2.htm">Uriah and Betsy (Doud) Edgecomb</a> moved to Bath Township in
1832 and purchased land in section 3. Presumably Betsy communicated with her
sister <a href="5.htm">Fanny (Doud) Lewis</a> of Lordstown Twp., Trumbull Co.,
OH about their new home and this information was shared with the siblings of
<a href="7.htm">John Lewis</a> (Fanny's husband). <a href="3.htm">Elsie (Lewis)
Bassitt</a> (John's sister) and her husband (also of Lordstown) decided to buy
land in section 13 in 1834. On 15 Sep 1835, John (Elsie's brother) and Fannie
(Betsy Edgecomb's sister) bough land in section 14 adjacent to Elsie and Samuel.
On the same day, Betsy (Elsie's sister) and Peter Snyder (i.e. Peter b.c.1793,
also of Lordstown) bought land in section 11 adjacent to John and Fanny's land.
In 1836, Samuel and Elsie Bassitt moved to Bath Township. However, John and
Fanny Lewis apparently never left Lordstown Twp., Trumbull County and eventually
they sell their land to others. On 25 Feb 1836 <a href="7.htm">Jonathan</a>
(brother of Elsie Bassitt, John Lewis, and Betsy Snyder) and Nelly Lewis buy
land in section 14 adjacent to John and Fanny Lewis and Peter and Betsy Snyder.
They move there sometime before 1840 (perhaps with the Bassitts). </p>

<p><b><a name="lived"></a>Did Peter Snyder (b. 1820) live with Peter (b. c.1793)
and Betsy Snyder in Bath Twp.?</b></p>

<p><a href="g.htm">Peter</a> (b. 1820) was the youngest of twelve children of
<a href="1.htm">Philip and Mary (Sharpsteen) Snyder</a>, and was born in
Livingston County, New York. Philip died in about 1824 when Peter was four years
old. Peter probably lived with his mother or an older sibling (or both) until he
was twelve or thirteen years old. At that time (about 1833), Peter moved to
Trumbull County, Ohio where he stayed with his brother Lorenzo for about a year.<a href="#11"><sup>11</sup></a>
(Lorenzo was married in Trumbull County in 1832.<a href="#12"><sup>12</sup></a>)
This insinuates that his mother was not living in Trumbull Co. at that time. Why
did he stop living with his brother? If the birth dates of Lorenzo's children
can be trusted as clues, Lorenzo and Julia Ann may have returned to New York by
1834.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This leaves the question of with whom Peter lived after Lorenzo left Trumbull
Co. In these late 19th century biographies, the stalwart and independent pioneer
subjects make their way on their own. However, the reality seems to be that they
more often moved and lived with relatives: siblings, in-laws, uncles, etc. It is
possible that Peter (b.1820) lived with a relative (perhaps uncle), the Peter
Snyder born c.1793 who was living in Lordstown, Trumbull County at the time.
Although I have no direct evidence that Peter (b. c.1793) was an uncle to Peter
(b.1820), it was common practice to name children after aunts and uncles at that
time. When Peter (b.1820) was 18 or 19 years old, he moved to Bath Township.<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup>
An obvious place for him to have lived at that time was with his brother,
Lorenzo. However, Lorenzo and Julian Ann sold the last of their land in Bath
Township in 1840 and were living in Hinsdale, Cattaraugus Co., NY at the time of
the 1840 census<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup>.&nbsp; So if Peter lived with
Lorenzo, it would not have been for long. </p>

<p>After Peter (b.1820) married Clarinda Edgecomb, his biography says that &quot;he
then rented a farm of 160 acres&quot;.<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup> Where was this
farm? Referring to the <a href="images/1830s.gif">plat map</a>, one could
hypothesize that it was a part of Peter Snyder (b. c.1793)'s farm in section 11
- in particular the southwest quarter section. If Peter (b.1820) had been living
with his putative uncle (Peter Snyder b. c.1793) in Trumbull County, they could
have moved together to Bath Township in 1838-39. (The elder Peter moved to Bath
Twp. sometime between 1835 and 1839.)&nbsp; If this were true, Peter (b.1820)
would have ended up living a mile south of <a href="2.htm">Uriah Edgecomb</a>'s
farm. This would give him an opportunity to begin seeing Uriah's 16-17 year old
daughter, Clarinda.&nbsp; After she became pregnant, they got married in 1840.
The elder Peter soon moved back to Trumbull County, but the younger Peter, now
permanently entangled with the Edgecombs, stayed.&nbsp; In 1849, Peter (b.1820)
purchased what was known in 1885 as the &quot;Hiram Prottsman farm&quot;. Examination of
the 1880 map of Bath Twp.<a href="#15"><sup>15</sup></a> and land transactions
recorded in Lima show it to be a part of the elder Peter Snyder's 160 acres in
section 11. So it is possible that Peter's purchase of a farm in 1849 does not
represent a move, but rather represents Peter and Clarinda finally accumulating
enough money to buy the farm on which they have been living since they were
married.</p>

<p><font size="2"><a name="18"></a>18. Rick Gustafson provides the following
information: &quot;Now the interesting part - 1830 Census for Lordstown, OH has your
Peter Snyder listed which lists a unknown daughter of between 14 and 16 years
old.&nbsp; Our Rosetta Snyder with a birth year of 1815 would be the right age.&nbsp; Then
in the 1830 Lordstown census, [two lines above] Peter Snyder,
there is a listing for a James Richardson, which list two males&nbsp;the right age
for William Richardson.&nbsp; While this does not prove that Rosetta Snyder is the
daughter of Peter Snyder and William Richardson is the son of James Richardson,
this 1830 Lordstown census is the only Ohio census that I have found that have
both Snyders and Richardsons together.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>James Richardson is listed in
the 1840 Lordstown, Trumbull, OH census.<br>&nbsp;<br>James Richardson seems to have
died between 1840 and 1850 as there is not a list for them that is the right
age.&nbsp; There is a listing for a James Richarson who I believe is the son in the
1850 Lordstown census.&nbsp;&nbsp; A Margaret Richardson, age who make her his mother, is
living with James Richardson.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2">This information, the fact that Peter, Alzina, Ambrose, and
Cicero were living in Pleasant Twp., Steuben Co., Indiana at the same time as
Rosetta and William Richardson, and the fact that a Peter Snyder married Rosetta
Snyder and William Richardson provides strong circumstantial evidence that
Rosetta is a daughter of Peter.&nbsp; In addition, the sale of land from Peter
to William Richardson at the same time as the sale to Cicero with Cicero and
William each witnessing the other's transactions (footnotes 9 and 20) provides
additional strong circumstantial evidence to support the assumption that Rosetta
was a sister to the others.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font size="2">It should also be noted that if this hypothesis is true, then
Rosetta Richardson, whose mother was Betsey (Lewis) Snyder and Lewis Bassitt,
whose mother was Elsie (Lewis) Bassitt, would have been cousins and would have
lived near each other for some time in both Trumbull County and in Allen County.&nbsp;
In 1850, Lewis named his oldest daughter Rozetta.&nbsp; Rozetta is a rather
unusual name and no other family members bear this name.&nbsp; Therefore it is
likely that Lewis named his daughter after Rosetta Richardson, who might have
been his older playmate or babysitter.</font></p>
