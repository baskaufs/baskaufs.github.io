<p>With one exception, Bassetts and Bassitts living in Allen County, Ohio prior 
to 1900 have a known connection to <a href="3.htm">Samuel Bassitt</a> (b. 1795) 
who emigrated there in 1836.&nbsp; This exception is Mariah Bassett Wood, wife 
of Harmon Wood.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Mariah Bassett was born in 1806<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> in Genesee Co., NY<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.&nbsp; The identity of 
her parents is not known.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>&nbsp; She married Harmon 
Wood (b. 11 May 1800 in 
Otis, Berkshire Co., Massachusetts to James and Mary Wright Wood<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>) in about 1828.&nbsp; This may have occurred when they lived in 
Geauga County, OH, although a family tradition said that they were married &quot;on 
the wagon train from New York&quot;<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>.&nbsp; Harmon 
and his family lived on the east side of Parkman Twp., Geauga Co., OH, near the 
Trumbull County line.&nbsp; Mary Wood was the first person buried in the Old 
Parkman Cemetery, although there is no marker for her grave.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Harmon and Mariah were early settlers of Bath Township, Allen Co., OH.&nbsp; 
Harmon Wood bought land in the <a href="images/1830s.gif">northwest quarter of the southeast quarter of 
section 4</a> on 20 Jul 1833.&nbsp; He was on the Allen County tax rolls in 1834,<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> so 
he was living on his land by then.&nbsp; Mariah and Harmon had the following 
children:<sup><a href="#1">1</a> <a href="#6">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Harmon died on 10 
Sep 1877.<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp; Harmon and Mariah are said to be 
buried in the Berryhill Cemetery, Bath Twp., Allen Co., OH, but there is no 
known marker there for their graves.<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup></p>

<p>One of the recurring themes of the history of the Bassett, Edgecomb, and 
Snyder families is that family members rarely moved west in isolation.&nbsp; In 
most cases, it appears that some family connection influenced the decision to 
buy land or to move to a particular area.&nbsp; It is therefore tempting to 
speculate that Mariah Bassett was a relative of <a href="3.htm">Samuel Bassett</a> because they 
lived within a few miles of each other in Bath Township.&nbsp; Mariah's age 
would be reasonable to place her as a sister of Samuel - <a href="6.htm">Samuel was born in 1795 
and his brothers with known birth dates were born in 1789 and 1796</a>.&nbsp; So if 
Mariah was a sister she would have been one of the younger siblings.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Her birthplace in Genesee county is somewhat problematic since her putative 
father, <a href="6.htm">William Bassett</a> was not known to have lived as far west as present-day 
Genesee County.&nbsp; However, there were many changes in the boundaries of 
counties in central and western New York around the time of her birth, so it is 
possible that what was Genesee County at that time was closer to where William lived.&nbsp; 
It is also possible that only Harmon was born in Genesee County and that 
Mariah's birth there was assumed (I have only second-hand sources stating that 
she was born there).&nbsp; It is also suggestive that Harmon and Mariah lived in Parkman Twp., Geauga County, Ohio 
because it is adjacent to Trumbull County where so many Bassett, Edgecomb, and 
Snyder families (including <a href="3.htm">Samuel Bassitt</a>) lived.&nbsp; However, the supposed 
relationship would be more convincing if they lived in the same township as 
other family members.</p>

<p>Other alternatives are that Mariah may have been a cousin to Samuel and there 
is the possibility that she was no relative at all and that her presence in Bath 
Township was merely a coincidence.&nbsp; Additional information is needed to 
shed light on these questions.</p>
