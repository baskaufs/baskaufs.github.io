<p>It is difficult to know the details of the early life of Robert and Elsie 
(Lewis) Edgecomb because there are no written accounts of their early life. 
However, some things can be inferred from land records and the places they 
lived. Robert bought 40 acres in section 10 of Bath Twp., Allen Co., OH next to 
his father <a href="2.htm">Uriah</a> on 23 Apr 1835 at age of 18. So he was probably living near or 
with his father at the time that he married &quot;Elsey&quot; Lewis on 16 Jan 1838. Elsie, 
born in 1818 in Solon, NY was a daughter of <a href="7.htm">Jonathan and Nelly Lewis</a>, who lived 
a little over a mile from the Edgecombs in section 14. Jonathan was probably a 
brother of the <a href="3.htm">Elsie Lewis who married Samuel Bassitt</a>; thus Robert's wife Elsie 
was named after her aunt who lived about a mile further down the road from 
Jonathan. Robert and Elsie had the following children: </p>

<p>After their marriage, Robert and Elsie apparently moved several miles to the 
north in Monroe Twp. where Robert's brother <a href="d.htm">Lansil</a> owned land and where several 
other Lewis' lived. We know this because when Robert bought land in section 35 
(near the Disciples meetinghouse) on 23 Sep 1843, he was described as &quot;of Putnam 
County&quot;<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup>. Before the reorganization of Allen County in 1848, Monroe Township was 
a part of Putnam County. On 15 May of 1846, Robert and Elsa of Putnam County 
sold this property<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup>. This is apparently when they moved back to Bath Township. In 
the previous year, Robert's father <a href="2.htm">Uriah</a> had sold out and moved to section 11 
and by 1850 several of Robert's brothers and sister were living near each other 
there. Although the 1850 census does not give an &quot;address&quot; for the persons 
recorded, the households are reported in approximately the order in which they 
were encountered by the census taker. The census reports Robert and &quot;Elsy&quot; three 
households after Elias Everet, who was known to have lived on the corner of 
Bluelick Rd. and the Dixie Hwy, and immediately after <a href="#7">&quot;Pegley&quot; and Elisabeth 
Lewis</a><sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup>. Thus it is likely that they lived on Bluelick Road between the Dixie Hwy. 
and Thayer Rd. They may have been living on part of the farm that <a href="#7">Jonathan and 
Nelly Lewis</a> bought in section 14 in 1836; &quot;Pegley&quot; was Elsie's brother, Peleg.
</p>
<p>Sometime after Robert and Elsa moved back from Monroe Township, they became 
associated with the Sugar Creek German Baptist, or Dunkard church (now called 
the Church of the Brethren). The Sugar Creek church was started by Elder Abraham 
Miller who moved to the Sugar Creek settlement in the northwest corner of the 
township in 1833 making it one of the oldest congregations in Bath Township.<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup> At 
that time the church met in members' homes and did not have paid ministers. 
Elder Miller preached in German, so it seems as though his ministry must have 
been primarily to the families of other Brethren immigrants given that most Bath 
Township residents spoke English. The church had eleven members in 1840 and 
thirty in 1845. In 1846, the family of David and Elizabeth (Miller) Weaver moved 
from Virginia to section 9 of Bath Township. On 15 November 1846, he wrote to 
his family in Virginia to report on how they were doing. &quot;… I would have wrote 
to you long ago if I could write myself and now I have got some person to write 
to you and I will first let you know that I had a spell of the intermitting 
fever and I took it about the 20 of Sept. and I wasn't able to work anything 
until about 10 days ago but now I am tolerable stout again and little Bethy and 
Davy had the chills and fever but they are well again and there has been very 
sickly here this fall but few deaths. </p>
<p>&quot;Now I will let you know something about ower country and so we had a very 
dry season here this summer but with all we raised a tolerable good crop of corn 
which we planted the 27th of May so that we have a plenty to do us and I suppose 
we raised about 30 loads of pumpkin and I let you know that we live in a 
plentiful country and we like this country well and let you know that we had 
grate crop of wheet here this harvest that I can say that I never saw such wheet 
in Virginia and with all the drowth we had grate crops of hay and I let you know 
that we think we have made a grate exchange by comeing to this country and I 
believe that I have very good land so that I wouldhn't give my plase for any 
plase that I have had yet … P.S. Dear friends I have another attact of the ague 
sence this was wrote and had it opened to inform you of it. Betsy is very much 
discouraged with the ague that I have tho she has had her health sence we came 
to this state, D.W.&quot;<sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup> </p>
<p>On 24 Jan 1847 he wrote to his parents in Virginia. &quot;I embrace this 
opportunity to write a few lines to you having written to you in a former letter 
about our being unwell as our country around us has been brushed smartly with 
sickness such as fever and ague. We also had to suffer somewhat along with the 
rest of the neighbors. … I will now write a few lines to Elizabeth's mother If 
she has any notion of coming out here ther is a good little house now for sale 
here about sixteen acres of land well improved It is all cleared but I have a 
plenty of timber so there will be no difficulty in getting wood …The land lies 
in a good Germin settlement …&quot;<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup> </p>
<p>Several interesting things can be inferred from these passages. Although 
David Weaver identifies with the &quot;good Germin settlement&quot;, he writes in English. 
So despite their distinctive religious customs, he and other Brethren immigrants 
to Bath Township were able to integrate well with the non-Brethren members of 
the community. (In contrast, the Swiss Mennonite immigrants to Bluffton in Allen 
County continued to speak their dialect of German into the 20th century.) 
Reports of good land and crops influenced many other friends and relatives to 
move from Virginia to Allen County over subsequent decades until a significant 
fraction of the residents of northern Bath Township and eastern German Township 
(now American Township) were members of the Brethren community. Finally, it is 
clear that malaria (known at that time as &quot;the ague&quot;) had become a significant 
health problem in the Sugar Creek settlement. At that time, the cause of the 
ague was not known, although it was associated with the &quot;bad air&quot; of swamps and 
wetlands. When the Sugar Creek settlement was started, its proximity to a good 
source of water was probably a major factor in the choice of site, but with its 
close proximity to the clouds of mosquitos of Great Black Swamp (which carried 
the malarial parasite) and the increasing pool of white settlers to harbor the 
malarial disease, living near the creek may have become a net negative factor.
</p>
<p>How was a &quot;Connecticut Yankee&quot; such as Robert Edgecomb drawn to an 
essentially &quot;ethnic&quot; group like the Brethren, given that nearly all church 
members were from intermarried German families from Virginia? Preaching at the 
Sugar Creek church was done exclusively in German until about 1840 and after 
that &quot;sermons were preached in the English language occasionally&quot;<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup> . A possible 
explanation is the proximity of Robert and Elsie's farm to Brethren families. 
The 1850 census shows him living near the family of Lewis and Catharine Miller 
from Virginia. Although the background of this family is not known, they are 
likely to be related to the many Brethren Millers who lived in Bath Township. So 
Robert and Elsie may have been drawn to the German Baptist church through 
interactions with their neighbors. Robert's conversion must have been a profound 
one because by the late 1850's, Robert was called to the ministry. He preached 
(presumably in English!) in the new meeting house that had been constructed in 
1853 on Bluelick Rd. in section 7, about four miles from where Robert lived<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup> .
</p>
<p>In 1856, Robert's sister <a href="g.htm">Clarinda Snyder and her husband Peter</a> sold their 
land<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup> near Robert and moved to Shawnee Township. Robert's father 
<a href="2.htm">Uriah</a> and 
brother <a href="i.htm">Marquis</a> sold their land<sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup> near Robert and moved to Beaverdam in Richland 
Township. Both of these pieces of land were sold to David Weaver (who was 
serving as a minister <sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup>), making David and Elizabeth neighbors to Robert and 
Elsie in 1860 <sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup>. </p>
<p>Robert and Elsa sold land in section 12 of Bath Township in 1859<sup><a href="#23">23</a></sup> and 1862<sup><a href="#24">24</a></sup> 
and this may have been associated with their move since many members of the Brethren church began moving west after 1860.&nbsp; 
In 1863, Robert Edgecomb and his family moved to Piatt County, Illinois,<sup><a href="#25">25</a></sup> 
where many descendants of Robert's son Uriah live today. On 5 Feb 1865, Wilson 
enlisted in Company I of the 150th Illinois to fight in the Civil War. It is not 
known how this decision was received by the church, since the Brethren church 
was a &quot;peace church&quot; that did not believe in participation in war. On 7 Feb 1865, Robert's son William married Anna Miller, daughter of Jacob B. and 
Salome (Wine) Miller. Jacob Miller was a brother to Elizabeth Weaver (their 
neighbor) and a minister of the Brethren Church who moved to Piatt Co., IL in 
1870.<sup><a href="#26">26</a></sup> </p>
<p>In 1866, the church territory was divided and the part south of a road 
running east and west three miles south of Cerro Gordo was named the Okaw church 
after a nearby stream. For ten years, this church was without a meeting place 
and members met in schools, churches, and barns.<sup><a href="#27">27</a></sup> 
On 10 Oct 1867, Wilson was married to Mary Jane Ulrey by Elder John Metzger, who 
presided over the Okaw church. In 1869, Robert and John Arnold drove 18 miles 
through zero degree weather to hold a meeting near Bethany in Moultrie County. 
On a Sunday, they cut through eight inches of ice to hold a baptism in a nearby 
river.<sup><a href="#28">28</a></sup> In 1870, Robert and Elsa were living in Cerro Gordo Township of Piatt Co., 
IL.<sup><a href="#29">29</a></sup> Their neighbors were Charles and Martha Huff and several children of these 
families married. Harriett &quot;Hattie&quot; married George Washington Huff on 7 Apr 1870 
and Samuel married Maria Miranda &quot;Mira&quot; Huff on 17 Jan 1872.<sup><a href="#30">30</a></sup> </p>
<p>In 1873, Samuel and Robert Wilson (two sons of Robert), John and Sarah Ann 
Overley (daughter of Robert), and George and Harriett Huff (another daughter of 
Robert) moved to the southwest corner of Crawford Co., KS.<a href="#31"><sup>31</sup></a> 
The following year, Robert and Elsie settled nearby along with their daughter 
Mary. It is said that Robert Edgecomb offered $1000 to each of his children who 
agreed to move to Kansas.<sup><a href="#32">32</a></sup> In 1875, his daughter 
Ellen Tridle moved to Kansas with her husband.<sup><a href="#33">33</a></sup> In 
the spring of 1878<sup><a href="#34">34</a></sup>, J.B. Wolfe, D.D. Shively, 
J.C. Neher, John Ulery, and Samuel Ulery, who married Mary Edgecomb, moved from 
Piatt Co., IL to Osage<sup><a href="#35">35</a></sup> and settled on land bought 
from the railroad. </p>
<p>In 
June of 1878, the Osage Church of the Brethren congregation was founded by Robert Edgecomb.&nbsp; 
On August 15, Samuel Edgecomb was selected to minister to the congregation.<sup><a href="#36">36</a></sup>&nbsp; &quot;The congregation first met in 
the Osage Schoolhouse. Sometimes services were also held in a straw barn on 
Lightning Creek and in the Christian Church. A charter was obtained in 1881, and 
the first church building was erected in 1885.&quot;<sup><a href="#37">37</a></sup> The distinctive practices of the 
Brethren evoked the curiosity of their non-Brethren neighbors. The local paper 
reported that &quot; 'the Dunkards part their hair in the middle and kiss each other 
like women when they meet.' The Brethren custom of foot-washing also drew 
attention from neighbors of other denominations. 'People would come from miles 
around to see the foot washing … Sometimes so many onlookers came that worship 
was impossible.' Two of the most obnoxious onlookers were arrested, put on trial 
in Girard and sentenced to jail time. 'It's interesting that some of those 
obnoxious onlookers were later converted' … To block the view of the curious, 
the lower windows of the church were painted white …&quot;<sup><a href="#38">38</a></sup>. </p>
<p>In the 1880s, the Brethren Church was rocked by schisms between conservative 
members who felt that the church had strayed too far from their roots of plain 
dress, simple lifestyle, and church discipline and progressives who felt that 
the church had not gone far enough in promoting higher education, salaried 
ministers, and Sunday Schools<sup><a href="#39">39</a></sup>. In 1881, this 
conflict came to a head and the conservatives split to form the Old German 
Baptist Brethren. In 1883, the progressives formed the Brethren Church. The 
majority of the Brethren remained in the moderate group which continued to use 
the name &quot;German Baptist Brethren&quot; until 1908. The church conflicts affected the 
Edgecombs, with Robert and his son William, going with the Old Order<sup><a href="#40">40</a></sup> 
and the rest of the family remaining in the main body of the church. The result 
was that in 1881 &quot;Robert Edgecomb lost his eldership&quot;<sup><a href="#41">41</a></sup> 
at the Osage Church. Eventually Robert returned to the main body and was 
reinstated to the ministry. However, the family was effectively split with 
William and the rest of the family effectively shunning each other to the extent 
that until recently family contact was lost. Descendants of William presently 
live in the Garnett, Kansas area and attend the Cedar Creek Old German Baptist 
Brethren church.<sup><a href="#42">42</a></sup> </p>
<p>Elsie died in 1891 and Robert died on 4 Sep 1898 in Crawford Co., KS. Robert 
and Elsie Edgecomb are buried in the cemetery of the Osage church. Descendants 
of Samuel and Wilson still live in Kansas today. In later years, other Robert 
Edgecomb descendants went further west - to Oklahoma, California, Idaho, and 
Washington. </p>
