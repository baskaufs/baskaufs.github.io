May the 27 A.D. 65 </p>
<p>Respected Father and Mother </p>
<p>This being a wet and rainy morning I thought that I would engage my time in 
writing you a few lines to let you know that I am still on the land amonst the 
living and sincearly hope and trust that those few unworthy lines may chance to 
find you enjoying the same state of good health I am still at camp Dennison and 
in the best of spirits but cant tell you when I will be at home I may be at home 
next week and then again I may not get home for one month It is hard to tell My 
Descriptive Roll has not come yet as I know of. They have mustered some few out 
but not very many yet It is awful wet here and has been for the last too or 
three weeks The Grand Review of the Army Commanded by Major General W. T. 
Sherman Took place at Washington yesterday morning And I suppose will soon start 
to their own Respective States to be mustered out of the United States Service 
to return to their own Native Homes once more to live in peace and quietutude 
once more. </p>
<p>Well Father the aint much sight of me being mustered out for one or too 
months but I am waiting patiently for the time to come Father I received a 
letter from you the other day and was glad to here that you were all well. </p>
<p>Well Father I must bring my scribbling to a close hoping to seeing an answer 
soon. I remain your true and most affectionate son. Samuel Bassitt </p>
<p>Address&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Camp Dennison Ohio <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Ward 6 Division 2</p>
<p>And write soon and give all the news. </p>
<p> <br>
Excuse my poor writing and bad spelling and I will try and do better in the 
futur </p>
