<p>My dear <a href="../l.htm">Father and Mother</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; This morning finds 
me in Tennessee and at Nashville. We started from Columbus a Thursday in the 
afternoon at three o'clock and we come to Indianapolis in Indiana. We arrived 
there at too o.clock and then we got our brekfast and then we came up to 
Jeffersonville Indiana and then we crossed the Ohio river on the stemboat and we 
landed in Louisville Kentucky and then we got on the cars and come up to 
Nashville Tennessee and who knows where we will go next or dont. The is talk of 
us agoing to Chatanooga Tennessee or at Noxville. They have had another Battle 
at noxville Tennessee. The troops are all well at the present time. But the is 
some of them has got a bad coald. I have got a cold but am in the best of 
spirits. When i wrote that letter to you i had got it about half wrote and the 
order came for every man that belonged to the 27 to pack napsacks and i had to 
bring it to a close quicker than i would.&nbsp; So i must bring my few lines to 
a close by sending my best respects to Father and Mother and all the connecting 
friends. </p>
<p>From Samuel Bassitt to <a href="../l.htm">Lewis Bassitt and Sarah</a>. </p>

February the 22nd, 1864 </p>
<p>My dear <a href="../3.htm">Grand Father and Grand Mother</a><sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> i thought that i

talk of agoing to Chatanooga or noxville but i dont know where we will be taken 
to. i have seen a great deall of the world since i left you. We went through 
mountains. We went through a channel too miles long and it was just as dark as 
anything you eve saw. You couldnt see your hand before you. We passed large 
plantations where the was half a dozen nigger shanties. I seen where old morgan 
went through Indiana and where he camped the was horses laying on the field. One 
place the was over one hundred hed of ded horses laying on the field. </p>
<p>So i must bring my few lines to a cloas. From Samuel Bassitt to Grand Father 
and Grand Mother. I remain your affectionate </p>

hard crackers and charcoal Coffee. So i must Bring my letter to a close. </p>

<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
<p><a name="1"></a>1.&nbsp; In 1860, Samuel and his parents lived in the same 
household with his grandparents, Samuel and Elsie Bassitt.&nbsp; Neither of the 
grandparents could read, so letters directed to them would have been read to 
them by Samuel's parents.&nbsp; (<a href="../census/1860-oh-allen-bath-407.jpg">see 
1860 census</a>)</p>
