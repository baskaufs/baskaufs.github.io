</p>
<p>My dear Father and Mother: </p>
<p>It is with the greatest of pleasure that i take my pen in hand to enform you 
that i am well and hearty and in the best of spirits. i received your kind and 
most welcome letter the morning of the 2nd and was glad to hear from you once 
more. Well Father we have mad a move since i wrote to you. We left Decatur 
Alabama on the morning of the 1st of May and we march 15 miles and then put up 
for loggin and then we marched 15 miles the next day to a place called huntsvill 
and there we staid all night and then the next day we marched 20 miles. And then 
that night we was ordered to be all ready against 5 o'clock in the morning to 
march and when morning came we was every one of us ready against 4 o'clock and 
then we marched 5 miles to a station called Scottsville and then we took the 
cars and started for Chattanooga. We arrived in Chattanooga at 1 o'clock on the 
morning of the 5th and we went in camp right at the back of lookout mountains 
where our boys charged up that mountain and drove the rebs away. Perhaps you 
missed of it being pubblished in the papers. i tell you now it is quite a hill 
hant been to the top of it yet. They say that the is quite a large town on the 
top of it. The name of the town is summerville. The is some of the boys been up 
and seen it. When the is one on the top of it it looks like a black speck and 
you can concider how high it is. </p>
<p>You wanted me to write whether i herd from any of the boys or not. I seen 
Ruben White<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> and Hiram Barber<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> this morning and they were all well, and i seen 
Snotgrass boys and ricer boys and they wer all well. Rube is the same old chap 
and as talkative as ever. They say that the fiftyfourth is acomeing in tonight 
and if they do i will get to see Wilson Allison and Watts boys. The was 8 trains 
all in a string came in last night all loded with soldiers. I tell you now that 
the is a large force here now. They are afighting out about 20 miles from here 
to a place called Ringgold. Old Johnson has atacted our army. They have been 
fighting for the last too days. The first day old Johnson drove our men back but 
yesterday our men held there own. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So i must bring my scribbling to a close. From </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Samuel Bassitt <br>
