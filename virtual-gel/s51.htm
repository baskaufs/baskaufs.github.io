<p>Johannes Schneider married Anna Elizabetha Lahmeyer on 12 Jan 1702. They were 
from the town of Huttengesass, Germany.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>&nbsp; In 
1703 they had twin sons, <b>Johannes</b> and <b>Johann Jost</b>.&nbsp; The 
second twin died five weeks after birth.&nbsp; In about 1705 they had another 
son named <b>Johann Jost</b> who was christened 6 Jan 1706 (married Magdalena 
Flagler).&nbsp; In 1708 another boy named <b>Balthazar Eisenach</b> was born, 
but died at an age of eight days.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>&nbsp; </p>

<p>This was a very turbulent time in the Palatinate with the War of the Spanish 
Succession raging through that part of Europe.&nbsp; The areas along the Rhine 
and Main Rivers were devastated with many homes and towns destroyed.&nbsp; Queen 
Anne of England offered for Protestants in the area to be resettled in the 
American colonies and over ten thousand refugees traveled down the Rhine to 
Rotterdam.&nbsp; From there they traveled to London where in the summer of 1709 
they awaited ships to take them to America.</p>

<p>At about this time, Johannes and Elizabetha had twins:</p>

<p><b>Christina</b>&nbsp; b. c.1709, m. Edward Diamond<br>
<a href="s25.htm"><b>Catharina</b>&nbsp; b. c.1709, m. Henry Busch</a></p>

<p>The London Board of Trade formulated a plan to locate the Palatines along the 
Hudson River in the colony of New York for the purpose of manufacturing naval 
stores for the British government.&nbsp; Ten ships with the capacity of 3000 
arrived late in 1709 and the refugees boarded.&nbsp; They lived under poor 
conditions and many died of disease caused by poor sanitation.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>&nbsp; 
Johannes and Elizabetha probably sailed on the <i>Hartwell</i> and settled in 
the village of Annsbury which was located along the Hudson in an area called 
&quot;East Camp&quot;, which was part of 6000 acres purchased from Livingston and known as 
the &quot;Livingston purchase&quot;.&nbsp; Each colonist was allocated a small lot on 
which to build a cabin and plant a small garden.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>In the summer of 1711 about 100 000 trees were &quot;barked&quot; to cause pitch to 
accumulate.&nbsp; However, due to lack of experience, the wrong kind of pine 
tree was stripped.&nbsp; The colonists barked mostly white pines which did not 
produce much tar and turpentine as compared to the hard pines used in the 
southern colonies.&nbsp; Thus many thousands of trees were destroyed to produce 
only about 200 barrels of tar.&nbsp; The Palatines did not like the work of 
making naval stores and felt that their contract had been misrepresented.&nbsp; 
By the fall of 1712 the project had basically collapsed.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Johannes and his family moved south from the East Camp to the town of 
Rhinebeck in an area purchased by Colonel Beekman.&nbsp; Each head of household 
had to pay &quot;one scheple of wheat&quot; (about a peck) per acre as annual rent.&nbsp; 
When the man who signed the lease died, the property reverted to Beekman.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>&nbsp; 
Eventually they moved to the neighborhood of Fishkill in the South Ward of 
Dutchess County where &quot;Jans&quot; (Johannes) Snyder appears on the tax lists in 
1718/19.<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>&nbsp; Their family consisted of three 
children who were probably Johann Jost (b. c.1705) and the twins Christina and 
Catharina.<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>&nbsp; The two daughters probably met 
their spouses and were married in Fishkill.</p>

<p>Johannes died sometime after 1753 in Dutchess County.</p>
