<p>Sometime around 1840, Elias Everett came to Allen County, where he purchased 
land in southwestern Monroe Twp. He was a surveyor as well as a farmer, and in 
about 1845 he surveyed part of the town of Delphos which was located on the 
Miami-Erie Canal in western Allen County<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. </p>
<p>On 19 Nov 1846<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>, he married Esther Olmstead, 
daughter of <a href="5.htm">George and Chloe (Doud) Olmstead</a> and niece of
<a href="2.htm">Uriah and Betsy Edgecomb</a>. The same year, he bought land in 
the &quot;Lordstown&quot; community of Bath Township, although he was still living in 
Monroe Twp in 1850. After Esther's death, on 13 Oct 1853 Elias married Marellah 
Lippencott Trumbo<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>, widow of Insley Trumbo.&nbsp; 
Eventually, Elias moved to his property in Bath Twp. where he served as a 
Justice of the Peace. Alice, daughter of Elias and Marilla married
<a href="l.htm">Philo Bassett</a>, who was their neighbor.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Elias married Mahala Roberts Fields (b. June 3, 1827, married Martin Fields 
in Allen County on March 28, 1848<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>) in Gilboa, 
Blanchard Township, Putnam County, Ohio on August 9, 1877.&nbsp; Mahala was 
living in Beaverdam on June 7, 1880, and Elias was a grocer there. Elias was an 
insolvent debtor on July 7, 1883, and on August 25, 1883, the Allen County Daily 
Democrat reported that he was going to reopen his grocery in a room south of the 
depot in order to liquidate his stock, and go out of business.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> </p>
<p>Elias died on February 22, 1885<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> and was buried 
in Rockport Methodist Cemetery.&nbsp; Mahala was a delagate to the Lima District 
Meeting of the Woman’s Foreign Missionary Society on June 27, 1889.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>&nbsp; </p>
