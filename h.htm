  <dt>Lydia Edgecomb was married to Warren Roberts on 15 November 1840 in Allen 
  County, Ohio.&nbsp; Warren was the son of Sylvester Roberts and Mary (Lewis) 
  Roberts who is presumed to be a sibling of Jonathan Lewis, Betsey (Lewis) 
  Snyder, and Elsie (Lewis) Bassett who moved to Bath Township, Allen County, OH 
  from Trumbull Co., OH.&nbsp; </dt>

<p>Based on the 1850 census<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, it appears that Lydia 
and Warren had one child, Lydia, who was born in about 1841.&nbsp; Lydia 
(the mother) presumably died soon after the daughter was born because Warren married on 9 Nov 1843 Mary A. Rumbaugh, 
born in Greene County, Ohio on August 2, 1824 and daughter of William and Anna 
(Aldridge) Rumbaugh.&nbsp; Warren and Mary had at least four more children: 
William (c.1844), George (c.1846), Warren (c.1848), and Hannah (1850).&nbsp; 
Warren died in Jackson Twp., Allen Co., OH in 1853.&nbsp; </p>
<p>After Warren's death, Mary &quot;married Daniel S. France in Beaverdam on August 
21, 1859 (later divorced after 1880). Daniel was born in Ohio in 1841, and 
resided in Beaverdam in July, 1860. The France’s moved to Allen County, Monroe 
Township, Monroeville, Indiana in 1862, and then Jefferson County, Kansas 
between 1869 and 1880. They resided in Allen County, Madison Township, Indiana 
on June 12, 1870. William Rumbaugh Sr. was made guardian of Francis, Milo, and 
Warren Roberts in 1867/68 (William Rumbaugh Jr. took over when his father 
died).&quot;<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>&nbsp; Mary died in Douglas County, North 
Lawrence, KS on 27 Dec 1898 and was buried in Maple Grove Cemetery in Douglas 
Co.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
