<p>Lorenzo Snyder married Julia Ann Brown or Browne on June 16, 1832 in Trumbull 
County, Ohio.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>&nbsp; when he was about 23 and she 
was 14.<sup> <a href="#7">7</a></sup>&nbsp; They had the following children, who were listed in the
<a href="#1850census">1850</a> and <a href="#1860census">1860</a> census 
records:</p>
<p>Mary Jane b. c.1834 in New York<br>
William b. c.1836 in Ohio <br>
Theodore b. 27 Aug 1844 in Cattaraugus, New York, m. Anthunette VanNess<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup><br>
Lydia A. b. c.1846-7 in Michigan<br>
Daniel b. c.1849 Michigan<br>
Phoebe b. c.1851 Michigan</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In about 1832 or 1833, Lorenzo and Peter moved to Trumbull Co., Ohio. Peter 
lived with Lorenzo for about year and afterwards worked by the month doing farm 
work during five months in the summer and attended school in the winter.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>&nbsp; 
Yet Mary Jane was recorded as being born in New York in about 1834.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Did Lorenzo return to New York just briefly or was this a longer-term move?&nbsp; 
Is a return to New York the reason why Peter only lived with Lorenzo for a year 
in Trumbull County?&nbsp; Was Peter <a href="s1.htm#lived">living with Peter 
Snyder (b. c.1793)</a> after Lorenzo and Julia Ann returned to New York?</p>
<p>In 1835, Lorenzo and his 
wife Julia Ann bought the southwest quarter of section 14 in Bath Township, Allen 
Co., Ohio. This is in the northwest part of the township where many other 
immigrants from northeastern Ohio settled, including the <a href="3.htm">Bassitts</a> and 
<a href="2.htm">Edgecombs</a>. 
It is not known where Lorenzo and Julia Ann were living at 
that time, but by Sep 1838, when 
they sold the north half of this land, they were described as &quot;of Allen County, 
Ohio&quot;<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> so William may have been born there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometime between 1838 and 
1840 they moved to Hinsdale, Cattaraugus Co., NY and sold the rest of their land 
in Bath Township, while Lorenzo's brother Peter married and remained in Bath 
Township.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>Sometime between 1844 and 1847 Lorenzo and his family moved to Michigan.&nbsp; 
Lorenzo died on December 3, 1852<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> and his mother Mary 
(Sharpsteen) Snyder died at their home there<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> on 11 
May 1853.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>&nbsp; After Lorenzo died, Julia Ann 
married Charles Smith and based on the <a href="#1860census">1860 census</a>, 
they apparently had a child, Samuel.&nbsp; Also living with the family was an 
Alice Snyder, but it is not clear whose child Alice was.&nbsp; Julia Ann died in 
1904.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup></p>

<a href="images/1832-marriage-license-trumbull-co-oh-159.jpg">marriage 
application</a> was taken out by Julia Ann Brown's step-father Stephen Brown and 
required his consent because she was only fourteen.&nbsp; An explanation for the 
similar last names maybe as described by Rick Gustafson: The 1830 census &quot;for 
Milton, Trumbull Co, Ohio has a&nbsp;Stephen Brown listed with his family members and 
two lines down is a listing for a Lydia Brown and her family members, but no 
male that would be her husband.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a daughter between the ages of 11 and 
15 (this could be Juliann).&nbsp;Then&nbsp;a Lydia Brown married a Stephen Brown in 
January 1831 in Newton, Trumbull Co, Ohio (see image of
<a href="images/1831-marriage-license-trumbull-co-oh-34.jpg">marriage license</a> and
<a href="images/1831-marriage-record-trumbull-co-oh-83.jpg">recording of the marriage</a>).&nbsp; 
Per Google Maps Newton, Oh and Lordstown, Oh are only about 7 miles apart.&nbsp; The 
distance between Milton, Oh and Newton, Oh is about 12 miles.&nbsp; My guess is that 
Lydia's first husband was Stephen Brown's brother.&nbsp; I think Stephen's first 
wife, can't find any proof of this, died during 1830 and he, Stephen, married 
his brother's wife, Lydia,&nbsp;and they combined families.&nbsp; If this was in fact the 
case the family would have about 15 to 17 members in 1831/32.&quot;&nbsp; The
<a href="images/1832-marriage-records-trumbull-co-oh-130.jpg">marriage</a> was 
performed by her father, Peter, who was a justice of the peace.&nbsp; &nbsp; </font></p>
