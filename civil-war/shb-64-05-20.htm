<p>My Dear Father and Mother -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May 20, 1864 </p>
<p>Kingston, Georgia </p>
<p>I am well and in the best of spirits and hope you folks are the same. Well 
Father we have laid still today that is to say we haven't marched any. We have 
had considerable skirmishing since we left Chattanooga. We drove the Rebs out of 
a town called Resaca but there was considerable loss on both sides. We have had 
skirmishes ever since with them. We are now within 60 miles of Atlanta. I tell 
you ole Grant is giving them fits up at Richmond, the news is that the Rebs are 
going to evacuate Richmond and then come down here and run us out, but I'll tell 
you they will have a sweet time if they undertake that game. Well Father you 
asked how I liked to be a soldier by now and I like it well so far. You 
mentioned you wanted to get a discharge for me since all soldiers under 18 was 
entitled to one. So you go ahead and get the papers showing I am under 18 and 
send them to the Provost Marshall and I can get my discharge. I must bring my 
scribbling to a close for now, </p>
<p>Your affectionate son until death. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Samuel </p>
