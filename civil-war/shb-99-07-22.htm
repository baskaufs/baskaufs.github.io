<p><i>This final letter serves as an epilogue to Samuel Bassitt's Civil War 
letters.&nbsp; </i></p>
<p><i>After  the Civil War, Samuel H. Bassitt returned home to live in Richland Township, Allen Co., OH. In 1868 at 
the age of 20, he married Mary Margaret Whipp (30 Oct 1850 - Oct 1932) who was 
18 at the time. Samuel and Mary were members of the Methodist Episcopal Church. 
They lived near the small town of Beaverdam where he taught school, worked as a 
carpenter, and later farmed.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> </i></p>
<p><i>The wanderlust in Sam that began with his Civil War experience never quite 
left him and eventually he abandoned his wife, leaving her to rear their nine 
children on her own. After they were divorced in 1895, he lived in Washington, 
D.C., where he worked as a clerk in the Treasury Department as chief of the 
clerical staff covering naval officers. He was married to Lizzie Mitchell. While 
he was working in Washington, he signed his correspondence &quot;S. H. Bassitt&quot;. </i></p>
<p><i>Samuel's children never knew him after he left home. As his son DeWitt 
said, &quot;I seen him at Grandpa's funeral. Rossie and Oak and I went up. ... 
Grandpa's funeral was at the house. And he was there and he was talking to 
Rossie and asking about his children, you know. And he said, 'Well, how about 
DeWitt?' 'Well', she said, 'ask him yourself - he's settin' right there beside 
you!' I was seventeen years old then. And I've never seen him since. And I had 
never seen him from the time he left home when I was seven until seventeen.&quot;<sup>
<a href="#2">2</a></sup> After Samuel died on 9 Mar 1925, he was buried in 
Arlington National Cemetery. </i></p>
<p><i>Most of Samuel's children worked in the oil fields of Allen County. Ohio 
during the boom years of the 1890s and later moved west to work in the oil 
fields of Texas, Oklahoma, and California. </i></p>

Washington, D.C., July 22, 1899 </p>
<p>Dear Father: </p>
<p>I am here in the office, and as it is fifteen minutes yet until time to 
commence work I have concluded to write you a few lines, a thing I have been 
wanting to do for a long time. We begin work at 9 o'clock in the morning and 
quit at 4 in the afternoon except on Saturdays when we quit at 3 o'clock </p>
<p>It is pretty warm here in Washington, yet I do not have to be out in the sun 
much. </p>
<p>Washington is a beautiful City and is classed as a Southern City. It has a 
population estimated at two hundred and seventy thousand, and seventy thousand 
are colored. It seems to me that there are more negroes here than that. </p>
<p>I am improving slowly. I had a sick spell last winter that left me in a very 
bad condition. I have the rheumatism, or something the matter with my shoulders, 
and the musles of my arms, which bothers me to the extent that I have been 
unable to dress and undress myself without assistance every since. </p>
<p>I have not doctored much for it hoping that in the course of time it would 
leave on its own accord. They nave been telling me that frequent bathing in the 
ocean would entirely relieve me. I concluded to try it and last Sunday went to 
Beach City on the Atlantic Ocean, and was in bothing for an hour and a half. The 
bottom was just splendid and we could go out at least 40 rods and did and not be 
in water deeper than our shoulders, which made it fine bathing. I got water in 
my mouth, several times and it was salty as brine. </p>
<p>After we came out of the water we ate our dinner and then went and lay down 
on the grass, in the shade, and took a good sleep. I cam home at 10 o'clock 
feeling tip top. </p>
<p>The next day I began to itch and burn, and by night I was broke out all over 
with blotches just like hives, and have been doeing but little else than to dig 
and scratch every since. </p>
<p>I got sun burnt wherever the sun shone on me and am now pealing off. As a 
result I am not much stuck on ocean bathing. </p>
<p>There is an insect found along the ocean beach called Chiger, and wherever it 
touches one it causes a spot to raise and it itches worse than any itch ever 
did. That was what was the trouble. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Wednesday, July 26 </p>
<p>I will now try and finish this letter. Some days I have 50 and 60 letters to 
write. Last Sunday I visited the Zoo. I think it is the finest and most 
interesting one I ever saw. It is very large and extensive, and I think they 
have every specie of annumal, fowel and fish that ever existed, and some of them 
are very fine specimens indeed. I counted 14 coon in one tree, and not a very 
large tree either. </p>
<p>I wish you were here so you could see some of the Sights and visit the many 
places of interest. </p>
<p>I expect to go to Philadelphia, Pa., next September, to attend the National 
Encampment. Why can you not come there too, and then come from there here and 
spend a month or such matter with me. It shall not cost you one cent to stay 
here, and the fare will be very cheap from your place to Philadelphia. </p>
<p>I want you to answer this Father and tell me all the news. How your crops 
are, and how you are all getting along. </p>
<p>How is the oil excitement, and have they found oil on your farm yet? </p>
<p>How is the wheat and corn, and hay and hogs. It has been so long since I have 
been in a wheatfield, or had anything to do with any such things, that I am 
getting rather homesick to be with them again, and see whether it would seem 
natural. </p>
<p>I am shut up here in the office from 9 in the morning until 4 in the 
afternoon without even the sun shining on me, yet I have become rather used to 
it. </p>
<p>Well I hope I may soon see you. Give my regards to all <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
