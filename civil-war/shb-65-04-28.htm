April the 28th, A.D., 1865 </p>
<p>Dear Father &amp; Mother: </p>
<p>It is with the greatest of pleasure that I seat myself in Ohio once more to 
write you a few lines to let you know that I still remain on the land amonst the 
Living. And hope you are in the same state of good health. I am in the hospital 
at Camp Denison, Cincinnati, Ohio. We arrived here this morning about 10 
o'clock. We got on the Boats at New York City at 2 o'clock Wednesday and crossed 
over into Jersey City in New Jersey and there we got on the cars at 5 1/2 oclock. 
and came down to Dunkirt New York where we changed cares and came to Cleaveland. 
There we changed cares and came to Columbus and changed cares and came through 
to Cincinnatti. We were too days and too nights a comming through the Distance 
of about five hundred and fifty miles. </p>
<p>I am no better than I was when I wrote to you last. I think that I am in a 
place now where I can get well for it is a prety nice place. When we came 
through on the cars I could see farmers to work on their farmes a planting corn. 
And I thought to myself I would like to be a farmer once more. I think that 
before very long if our armies keeps progressin on the way that they have in the 
last year we will all be returned that is spared to our homes to share the 
comforts with our Parents, Brothers and sisters once more around the family 
fireside and also family table. The boys was all when I left them at Goldsboro 
North Carolinia. </p>
<p>Father you may send me them things that I wrote for. The will be no danger of 
them getting lost. Father, I want you to send me some money if you will. I want 
you to send me ten ($10) Dollars for I am in kneede of it now. So you will 
Oblige a son. I think that we will get payed off here before long. When we do 
get payed off I will pay you thrible for all of fyour trouble. </p>
<p>I must bring my scribbling to a close hoping that these few unworthy lines 
may find you enjoying good health. I remain your affectionate Son </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Samuel Bassitt </p>
<p>Direct Samuel Bassitt, Camp Denison, Ohio, Division 2nd, Ward 6. </p>

best respect to only enquireing friends. Excuse my poor writing and bad 
spelling. </p>
