Marietta, Georgia, August the 13th, 1864 </p>
<p>Ever kind and affectionate Father &amp; Mother: </p>
<p>Time has placed an oppertunity this pleasant afternoon that i thought i would 
write you a few lines to let you know that i am well and Hearty and Hope and 
trust that those few lines may find you enjoying the same Health. I received a 
letter from you this morning and i also received 2 packages one containing 25 
sheets of paper and 15 Envellopes, the other had 2 towles and 2 Handkerchieves 
and some other things and the greates of all was the Portraits of my most 
beloved Father &amp; Mother which i had been Longin to see for the past 3 months and 
at last they arrived at Hand. Mother i think that your picture looked natural 
but Fathers diddent look so natural to me, as if i could see his face with my 
naked eye. </p>
<p>Well Father and Mother we are now camped in the edge of the town of Marietta. 
We came here on the evening of the 10 of August to do Guard here. We left the 
front on the morning of the 10. You better believe we have a little better time 
now than we have had for a time back. We dont haft to grind as much Hardtact as 
we have been in a habit of doing. We draw light bread scince we came. The news 
is that we are agoing to get payed off now soon, i wish that we would. This 
place is about twice as larg as Lima is and some of the buildings is a great 
deal larger than any in Lima. It is awfull warm down here yet. You wrote that 
you had got don harvesting and i was glad to hear it for i know that you have 
had to work hard this summer. But you have not been where you have been in 
danger all the time of having your nogin crackked. i tell you one will work 
pretty hard in building breastworks an fortifiing so that he can hid from them.
</p>
<p>The Nonvetterans in our regiment startes for home tonight. The rest of the 
boys in our Company is well and hearty. The aint much agoing on in camp today.
</p>
<p>So i will bring my scribbling to a close. From </p>
<p>Samuel Bassitt </p>
<p>To Father and Mother. Write soon. I most forgot to tell you that i received 
15 postage stamps in that letter which i got this morning and i tell you now 
they come just in the time of kneede. Write soon </p>
