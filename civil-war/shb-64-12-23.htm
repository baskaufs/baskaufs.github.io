Savana, Georgia <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
December the 23rd, 1864 </p>
<p>Respective Father &amp; Mother </p>
<p>Time has once more placed an oportunity of which i am engaged in writing you 
a few lines to let you know that i still remain well and hearty and sincearly 
hope and trust that those few unworthy lines may chance to find you the same. I 
received a letter from you about one weak ago dated the 9th of Nov. We then 
started off on a raid to the altamana river which is 50 miles from here. Well 
Father we have had conciderable of a time since i wrote to you last we have 
traveled some 485 miles and we have tore up 250 miles of railroads and we have 
also had some Pretty hard fighting to do We have had hard times on this campaign 
the boys come pretty near starving to death the was for 10 days i never saw a 
mowfull of rations only what we could forage out of the country the was one time 
we had one pint of rice issued to us for 3 days rations and another time the was 
one ear and a half of corn issued for three days i saw some of the boys give 
five dollars for five ears of corn and another fellow give fifteen dollars for 
three crackkers. So you can judge what times we have had while we was acoming 
through we just had all of the sweet potatoes and freash meat that we could eat 
but as soon as we struck Savana everything got foraged on in a little bit then 
we could not get anything till communications was opened and then we took fort 
Mccalister which is on the Ogeechee river and get communications we captured all 
of the guns and men that was in the fort. Savana has fallen into the hands of 
the fedral Soldiers and the stars and stripes now floats on the sea coast. The 
Rebs evacuated Savana on the evening of the 20 of December. They left all of 
their artillery and got out the best way they could. It is reported that they 
left one thousand pieces of Artillery. But they were all spiked. The boys all 
remain well and hearty. You may think Strange but it is as warm here now as it 
is up north in the summer time and we have marched 25 and 30 miles a day and 
carriad a big Knapsack. If a fellow wants to learn to soldier let him come down 
here and join Uncle Billy Sherman band. </p>
<p>Well, Father, about that Discharge. Do the best you can and hurry up. </p>
<p>1st Lt. William L. Watt has resined and went home he command our company. We 
have no company commanders now only an Ordely Sergt he commands our company and 
Capt. Morgan commands our regt. </p>
<p>Father, i want you to send me some Postage Stamps. </p>
<p>I remain your affectionate Son </p>
