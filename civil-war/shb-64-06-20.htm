Near Bigshanty station, Georgia </p>
<p>Dearest <a href="../l.htm">Father and Mother</a>: </p>
<p>It is with the greatest of pleasure that i take my pencil in hand to enform 
you that i am well and hearty and in the BEST of spirits and hope and trust that 
these few lines may find you enjoying the same state of health. I received your 
kind and most welcome on the evening of the 17th of June and i was glad to hear 
from you once more and was glad to here that you all was well and enjoying the 
comforts of life. </p>
<p>We have just advanced toward the enemy about half an hour ago and we are in 
sight of the rebs at this preasant time. The rebs is on Pinashaw mountain<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> and 
our Battery is a shelling them like evry thing. The is about 20 or 25 pieces of 
Artillery a playing on them now and they are a fireing by volleys and you better 
believe it makes conciderable nois when they fire. We are a driving the rebs 
evry day. When the rebs stays one night we stay there the next night. Our 
regiment was engaged in the fight one day but the was only too wounded in our 
Company oneof them was wounded in the left arm and the other one was wounded in 
the back. The Bullet went in at his left shoulder and cam out at the small of 
his back under his write arm. But he is agetting along fine. I did not get 
touched but they whicled pretty close some times. I shop so much that it made my 
shoulder conciderable sore, but i dont know wheather i hit any one or not. Our 
men takes prisoners evry day. The Skirmishers made a charge on the Rebble 
Skirmishers the other day and they captured 150 prisoners and the has been a lot 
of the rebs captured today. </p>
<p>It is reported that Old Geo. Hooke is a getting around in the rear of the 
rebs and if that is true the Rebs will either haft to fight or retreat. The rebs 
says that if they only could capture Old Jo Hooker they could whip our army like 
a flert(?). But he awlwas gets around and gets in the rear of them and then they haft 
to retreat or get their communications cut off. But i gess that it twill take a 
longer head than Old Jo Johnsons to get him in a trap where they can capture 
him. The was 10 or 15 wounded out of our Regiment and the was one Lieutenant 
kiled and one Private kiled. </p>
<p>Well Grandfather i gess that i will haft to bring my scribbling to a close 
for it is about suppertime and we aint allowed any fires here after dark. I 
remain your affectionat friend </p>
<p>From Samuel Bassitt </p>
