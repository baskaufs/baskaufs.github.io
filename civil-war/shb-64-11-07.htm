Marietta, Georgia, November the 7th, A.D. 1864 </p>
<p>Dear Mother: </p>
<p>I embrace the presant oportunity of writing you a few lines to let you know 
that i am still well and hearty and sincearly hope and trust that these few 
unworthy lines may chance to find you enjoying the same good health. </p>
<p>I received your kind and most welcome wrote letter yesterday and was truly 
glad to hear from you once more and to hear that you all were enjoying good 
health. </p>
<p>Well Mother we have not left this yet but we leave on the 8th and rejoin our 
Brigade which lays about four miles from this place. It is a raining here this 
evening and is pretty cold and disagreeable and it is tremendous muddy and it 
all is agoing to make hard, tiresome and disagreeable marching. We start with 
twenty (20) days rations along with us. I suppose that Reuben White has arrived 
at home with his little family<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. Tell him that i say he has got his head out of 
one good march. </p>
<p>Mother, you must write right away as soon as we (you?) get this letter. This 
road is not agoing to be abandoned and therefore mail can come through. You must 
write once evry weak wheather you receive any ancer from me or not for we aint 
agoing to have much time to write, but i will write as often as i can. We have a 
good deal to see to today and therefore i cannot write much. We have all of our 
tents to turn over and camp utencils so as to be ready when our Brigade is. I 
think we will get payed off before we leave Atlanta. We are agoing their 
tomorrow. And i will send my money home if i can any way a tall. You said that 
mabby i thought that you diddent want me to come home. Never never do i think of 
any such a thing. </p>
<p>Well Mother i haft to bring my scribbling to a close for we are called on to 
turn over our things emidiately. </p>
<p>You must write soon and often wheather you receive any answer from me or not. 
Goodby </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
From Samuel Bassitt </p>
