Kingston, Georgia, May the 22nd, A.D. 1864 </p>
<p>My dear grandfather and grandmother<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>: </p>
<p>It is with the greatest of pleasure that i take my pen in hand to enform you 
that i am well and hearty and in the best of spirits. The weather is warm and it 
is awfull hot here. Well Father we have had conciderable of a fight. We fought 
them three days with heavy loss on both sides. The fight was at Berraea Georgia. 
Out loss was three thousand kill, wounded and missing. The rebles loss is not 
known but is supposed to be a great deal larger than ours. Old Johnson retreated 
and is still on the retreat and our men is close to his heals. We captured one 
battery with 6 pieces and 64 pounders and also a lot of prisoners was captured. 
[turn over] </p>
<p>The report is that the rebs is agoing to make a stand at Atlanta Georgia but 
we have force enough to drive them away from any place they are amind to get. 
Our force is reported at 180 thousand strong and the prisoners that we take says 
that they have got 75 thousand. Our Regiment was not engaged in the fight every 
day but we stood ready to be called on any minute. The report is that we are 
agoing to start on another long march. We have drawed four days rations this 
morning and we haft to put it all in our havarsacks and i tell you now it makes 
them pretty full. The cars is arunnign from Chattanooga to Kingston and that is 
fifty nine miles from Atlanta where the rebs is. The report is that old Lee is 
agoing to evacute richmon and come and reinforce old Johnson but i gess if he 
evacuates richmond it will be because he hafts to. Grant has been fighting at 
richmon and he captured foity eight pieces of cannon and a lotof prisoners. </p>

From Samuel Bassitt </p>

<p>1.&nbsp; <a href="../3.htm">Samuel and Elsa (Lewis) Bassitt</a>.</p>
<p><a name="1"></a>2.&nbsp; &quot;Lordstown&quot; was the informal name given to the 
community in Bath Township, Allen County, Ohio in which the Bassitts lived.&nbsp; 
Many residents of that area emigrated from Lordstown Township, Trumbull County, 
Ohio to Bath Township during the 1830's and 1840's.&nbsp; </p>
