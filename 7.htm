<p><font size="1">Key words: Peleg Lewis, Lydia Lewis, Peleg and Lydia Lewis,
Pegley Lewis</font></p>
<p>Peleg and Lydia Lewis were probably from Massachusetts. Lydia may have been
Lydia Reed of Dighton, MA.<sup><a href="#2">2</a> <a href="#20">20</a></sup> <a href="#22">22</a></sup> Peleg served in the
Revolutionary War in August 1780 in Captain Peleg Peck's Company.<sup><a href="#2a">2a</a></sup>&nbsp; In 1790 they were listed in the town of Swanzey
(now Swansea),
Massachusetts. (The eastern section of old Swanzey was known as &quot;Somerset&quot;,
which was originally the native American name &quot;Shawomet<sup>&quot;.<a href="#16">16</a>)</sup>&nbsp; In the 1800 census they were living in the town of Shaftsbury,
Bennington Co., Vermont.<sup><a href="#2b">2b</a></sup> Sometime soon after that they moved to Otsego Co., NY
(living there in 1810).
Eventually, Peleg moved to Cortland County, NY (living there in 1820) where he served as Overseer of
Highways, a post later held by his son Jonathan. </p>
<p>The following is a list of their probable children. The first two were born
in Massachusetts and the rest probably in Vermont. </p>

<p>John, Peleg, and David Lewis moved to Trumbull County, Ohio by 1820 where
they were listed in the township of Warren<sup><a href="#6a">6a</a></sup>.&nbsp;
In 1826, Samuel Bassett, Peter Snyder, and Peleg and John Lewis were listed as
living &quot;north of the center&quot;.<sup><a href="#6b">6b</a></sup> On 21
June 1827 the first election for Township officers was held at James Kennedyâ€™s
house.&nbsp; Peleg Lewis was elected Trustee, and John Lewis was elected Constable.&nbsp;
David Lewis was appointed as Fence-viewer.&nbsp; On 7 January 1828 Peter Snyder was
elected Justice of the Peace.<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup>&nbsp; By 1830,
John, Peleg, David, Betsy and Elsie were living in Lordstown,
Trumbull Co.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> That year a church was organized at the
log cabin school house on the northeast corner of David's farm. David was
elected as a deacon with Elsie and her husband Samuel, Betsy and her husband
<a href="s1.htm">Peter Snyder</a>, <a href="h.htm">Mary and her husband Sylvester
Roberts</a>, Peleg, and David and his
wife listed as original members<sup><a href="#8">8</a> <a href="#9">9</a></sup>. Also listed as original members were Fanny and
Rachel Lewis. It is possible that Fanny and
Rachel were also children of Peleg and Lydia. </p>
<p>Peleg, Jr. married Philora UNKNOWN in about 1808. He may have had a
son Martin (b. 1809<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup>). Martin had a daughter listed in the census as &quot;Filora&quot;.
Peleg died in Warren, OH on 25 Aug 1858.&nbsp; See also <a href="#18">footnote
18</a>.</p>
<p>Jonathan and his wife Nelly (or Elanour)
moved to Bath Township, Allen Co., OH where he bought land near the
<a href="3.htm">Bassitts</a> in
1836<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup>. In 1838, their daughter, Elsie Lewis (1818-1891), married
<a href="e.htm">Robert Edgecomb</a>
who lived nearby. In 1846, Jonathan and Nelly essentially traded farms with
<a href="5eb.htm">Elias Everett</a><sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup>, whose mother-in-law,
<a href="5.htm">Chloe (Doud) Olmstead</a> was a sister to
Robert's mother <a href="2.htm">Betsey (Doud) Edgecomb</a>. This put Jonathan and Nelly in Monroe
Township (just north of Bath Twp.), the location where they spent the rest of
their lives. This location was near land owned by Martin Lewis, who was also
from Trumbull County and probably the eldest son of Johathan's brother Peleg.
Jonathan's eldest son was Peleg (b. 1819-20). In the 1850 census<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup> for Bath Twp.,
Allen Co., OH Peleg is listed just before Robert and &quot;Elsy&quot;. Thus these two
siblings (Peleg and Elsie) were living side by side near the farm bought by
their parents in 1836.</p>
<p>John Lewis married <a href="5.htm">Fannie Doud</a> (see <a href="5.htm">her
account</a> for more details).</p>
<p>Mary married Sylvester Roberts in Cortland County, NY in about 1817.&nbsp;
They lived in Cincinnatus, Cortland Co., NY until 1830 then moved to Lordstown,
Trumbull Co., OH.&nbsp; They had children Minerva, Warren (married
<a href="h.htm">Lydia Edgecomb</a>, daughter of <a href="2.htm">Uriah</a>),
Harriet, George Washington, Mahala (married Martin Fields then <a href="5eb.htm">
Elias Everett</a>), Lewis, Mary Jane, and Charity.&nbsp; Mary died there in
Trumbull Co. in 1832 and Sylvester married Lydia Maria Cole on 4 Oct 1832.<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup>&nbsp; They had a
daughter Margaret Ann (m. George Shipley).&nbsp; Sylvester and Lydia moved with
their families to Allen Co., OH.<sup><a href="#14">14&nbsp; </a></sup></p>

<p><font size="2"><a name="18"></a>18. The 1850 census does not show a record
for Peleg Lewis in Trumbull County.&nbsp; However, there is a Peter Lewis listed
in the <a href="census/1850-oh-trumbull-lordstown-peter-lewis.jpg">1850 census
for Lordstown Twp., Trumbull Co.</a> with wife Philura.&nbsp; That is such an
unusual name that it seems likely that Peter may actually have been a
misrepresentation of &quot;Peleg&quot;.&nbsp; The ages given (63 for Peter and 57 for
Philura) are consistent with those expected for Peleg and Philora as well as the
birthplace of Mass. for Peleg/Peter.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><a name="19"></a>19. The
<a href="images/1832-marriage-license-app-trumbull-co-oh.jpg">marriage license</a>
was applied for by Samuel Basset, Sylvester's brother-in-law (husband of Elsa)
on 3 Oct 1832.&nbsp; The
<a href="images/1832-marriage-records-trumbull-co-oh.jpg">marriage</a> was
carried out by Peter Snyder, Justice of the Peace and another brother-in-law of
Sylvester (husband of Betsy).&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><a name="20"></a>20. The following information was received
from Steve von Hitritz but has not been investigated further: &quot;In 'Edmund Lewis
of Lynn Mass' there is listed several Lewis families. the most tantalizing is
Samuel Lewis and Mary Martin, married in Swansea in 1758. I am reasonably
certain Peleg married Lydia Reed and Peleg's brother Samuel married Charity
Reed, Lydia's sister. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">In a history of the Reed family the Lewis to Reed marriages
are listed together. It appears they did not happen in Swansea but in Dighton as
the Lewis brothers are both referred to as &quot;from Swansey&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2">In another reference Samuel Lewis and mary martin are listed
with having 4 children, but I cannot identify the children. Their family is
conspicuously missing from the Edmund Lewis genealogy.&quot;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><a name="21"></a>21. Email from Ken Kinman, 9 Jan 2015. "His death record states that
  his parents were Peleg Lewis and Lydia.  So he is apparently one of the young unidentified males
  living with Peleg in the 1810 and 1820 census."</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><a name="22"></a>22. Email from Ken Kinman, 8 Aug 2017. "I have even more evidence indicating 
that Peleg Lewis Sr. was of Swansea, Massachusetts, and that his wife Lydia was Lydia Reed of Dighton.<br/>
Samuel Lewis (b. 1763) was almost certainly younger brother of Peleg, and Samuel married Charity Reed (b. 1765), 
sister of Lydia Reed.  So we have two sisters get married to two presumed brothers in the same town (Dighton) and 
just one year apart (and the marriage record says 'of Swansea').  Samuel and Peleg were then listed right next to 
one another in the 1790 Census of Swansea, Massachusetts.<br/>
Then I discovered that Samuel is almost certainly the S. Lewis listed right next to Peleg in the 1810 Census of 
Otsego County, New York.  And yesterday I finally found where Samuel Lewis and wife Charity were buried (Orleans 
County, New York).   See weblinks below.

</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><a name="23"></a>23. Email from Ken Kinman, 8 Aug 2017. "I am also trying to prove that Peleg's son 
Jonathan Lewis actually had two wives.  There is no female older than 14 years old listed with Jonathan Lewis that is 
the age to be his wife in the 1830 Census of Solon, New York (looks like it is just Jonathan and his children).  
Jonathan would have then married Eleanor ("Nelly") later in 1830 or in 1831.<br/>
The question now is who was his first wife.  I suspect her maiden name may have been Stebbins, since there were Stebbins 
on the same page with Jonathan in the 1830 Census, and at least one Stebbins family also moved to Trumbull County, Ohio.  
I suspect that she was a daughter or niece of Walter Stebbins who died in Solon, Cortland Co., New York, in 1827.  
And he is probably the W. Stebbins living in Otsego County in the 1810 Census (Lewis and Stebbins living in adjacent 
towns, so they could have even known each other at that time)."
