<p>On 3 Sep 1812 &quot;Samuel Basset of the Town of Butternuts in the County of 
Otsego&quot;, New York bought 100 acres in the southeast corner of lot 30 in 
Cincinnatus Township of Cortland County for $250<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. (This land lies east of 
Baldwin Corners Road 165 in the southeast corner of present day Cincinnatus 
Township, Cortland Co.) It is not certain that this was our ancestor. Given that 
he was born in 1795 he would have been only about seventeen years old at the 
time, which would have been rather young for him to have accumulated such a 
large sum of money. However, several pieces of circumstantial evidence suggest 
that this Samuel was our ancestor. Otsego County, New York does seem to be the 
place where our Samuel's family lived, although in 1820 they lived about 30 
miles to the north of Butternuts. In addition, according to family tradition, 
Samuel's son Lewis was said to have been born in Oswego Co., New York, which is 
unlikely but the similarity between &quot;Oswego&quot; and &quot;Otsego&quot; suggests that there 
may have been discussion in the family about Otsego County as a place where the 
family resided. </p>

<p>Cortland County, New York was a part of the Central New York Military Tract, 
which was set aside as compensation for veterans of the Revolutionary War. In 
the original survey, the area was laid out in townships ten miles square that 
were named for famous figures from Greek or Roman culture. These townships were 
subdivided into lots that were one mile square and numbered from one to one 
hundred from west to east in rows starting at the north side and going south. 
The original townships were later divided among counties and in many cases the 
townships themselves were further subdivided into other townships. We can 
definitely place Samuel in Solon, Cortland Co., New York on 1 Jan 1820 when he 
paid $260 for 50 acres in the northeast corner of lot 96 there and was described 
as &quot;Samuel Bassett of Solon&quot;<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. (This land lies just 
south of Hill Road in the southwest corner of present day Taylor Township, 
Cortland Co.) This location is only about six miles from the land bought by 
Samuel Basset in Cincinnatus, which lends further support to the idea that these 
two Samuels were the same person. </p>
<p>Samuel Bassitt and Elsa Lewis (b. 23 Oct 17953<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>) 
were married in about 1820. Given the uncertainty in the date of their marriage, 
the precise location cannot be known, although it is likely to have been 
Cortland County. There is no Samuel Bassett listed in the 1820 New York census, 
but a Peleg, Jonathan, and Abraham Lewis are listed as living in Solon.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> 
Elsa was probably the daughter of <a href="7.htm">Peleg Lewis</a> and the 1820 census lists two 
females aged between 16 and 26 in his household. One of them could have been 
Elsa, who would have been about 25 at that time. The names <a href="7.htm">Peleg and Jonathan 
Lewis</a> appear alongside that of Samuel Bassitt each time that Samuel moved in 
Ohio, so it is likely that either they were his neighbors in Solon, or that he 
bought land there to live near his in-laws. </p>
<p>Samuel and Elsie's first two children were born during the time when they 
lived in Solon<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>: <b> <a href="f.htm">Laura</a></b> on 16 Jun 1824<sup>6</sup> and
<b> <a href="l.htm">
Lewis</a></b> on 10 Nov 1825<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>. Their choice of the name Lewis is significant in 
several ways. Obviously it was Elsie's maiden name, but it may also have been 
the name of one of Samuel's <a href="6.htm">uncles</a><sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>. The name Lewis with that particular 
spelling has been given as a first or middle name to at least six of his 
descendants<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>. </p>

<p>In about 1826, Samuel and Elsie and their family moved to Lordstown Township, 
Trumbull Co., Ohio, where they were reported to have lived north of the center 
of the township<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup>. On 3 May 1827 &quot;Samuel Bassit&quot; and &quot;Elsa Bassit&quot; sold the 50 
acres in lot 96 of Solon<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup>. Their daughter 
<b>Mary</b> was born in about 1827. The 1830 census record shows a female under the age of 5 living 
with the family<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup> and a female aged 10 to 15 was also listed in the 1840 census.&nbsp; In Lordstown, their youngest daughter, 
<b><a href="w.htm">Lavisa</a></b> was born on 21 Jun 1832<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup>. </p>
<p>When the Bassitts moved to Lordstown, it was still largely unsettled by 
Europeans. The first white settler moved there in 1822 and by 1826 only about 14 
families were reported to be living there.<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup> The farmland there was not 
particularly productive and before artificial drainage, much of the land in the 
township was described as &quot;boggy waste&quot;.<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup> It is likely that they did not move 
there in isolation, but rather along with members of Elsie's family. Among the 
others listed as living near them in northern Lordstown Township in 1826 were 
<a href="7.htm">Peleg Lewis, John Lewis</a>, and <a href="1.htm">Peter Snyder</a>.<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup> As mentioned previously, we do not 
know Elsie's family relationships for sure, but Peleg and John Lewis were 
probably Elsie's brothers and Peter Snyder may have been an in-law. In 1830 
<a href="7.htm">David Lewis</a>, who was believed to be Elsie's brother is also mentioned along with 
John Lewis as living in Lordstown.<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup> </p>
<p>In the 1820's northeastern Ohio was swept by a great religious revival known 
as &quot;The Restoration Movement&quot;. Walter Scott, an evangelist and associate of 
Alexander Campbell, preached in the area in January 1828 and his fervor resulted 
in the formation of a number of congregations. On 20 March 1830, Rev. John Henry 
oversaw the formation of the first church in Lordstown at the log cabin school 
house on the northeast corner of <a href="7.htm">David Lewis</a>' farm on lot 28.<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup> This church 
became a part of the denomination that eventually became known as the Disciples 
of Christ. <a href="7.htm">David Lewis</a> was elected as a deacon and among the original members 
were Samuel and Elsie as well as several persons who were probably Elsie's 
relatives: <a href="7.htm">Peleg</a>, Fanny, and Rachel Lewis, and 
<a href="7.htm">David Lewis</a> and his wife. Also 
listed were <a href="1.htm">Peter Snyder</a> and his wife, and Betsy Snyder, people also probably 
associated with the Bassitts and <a href="2.htm">Edgecombs</a>. The Bassitt 
family remained associated with the Disciples of Christ over the next hundred 
years. </p>
<p>In the early 1830's a number of residents of the Trumbull Co., Ohio area 
became interested in moving to Allen County in northwestern Ohio. In many cases, 
it can be seen that there were family connections among those who made this 
move. This was true in the case of Samuel and Elsie as well. <a href="7.htm">John Lewis</a>, who was 
probably Elsie's brother was living near the Bassitts in Lordstown in 1830. His 
wife, <a href="5.htm">Fannie (Doud) Lewis</a> was the sister of <a href="2.htm">Betsey (Doud) 
Edgecomb, 
wife of Uriah Edgecomb</a>, the first Trumbull Co. immigrant to Allen County. 
Thus Samuel and Elsie would have had occasion to hear reports from 
<a href="2.htm">Uriah and 
Betsey</a> about the prospects in Allen County when they visited with
<a href="7.htm">John and 
Fannie</a>. </p>
<p>In 1834, Samuel purchased the west half of the northwest quarter of section 
thirteen, township three south, range seven east. This is the eighty acres 
southeast of the intersection of Bluelick and Thayer Roads in Bath Township. In 
order to finance the extension of the Miami Canal from Dayton to Lake Erie, the 
Congress put huge tracts of land in Northwestern Ohio up for sale and this land 
was part of that effort. </p>
<p>At the time the family moved to this property in 1836 it consisted of Samuel 
who was forty one, Elsie, thirty nine, and <a href="f.htm">Lorey</a>, 
<a href="l.htm">Lewis</a>, Mary, and <a href="w.htm">Lavisa</a>, aged 
twelve, ten, about eight, and four respectively. At that time, Bath Township was 
a wilderness with only patches of cleared land and a few blazed trails. 
According to family tradition, they lived in a small log cabin on this property. 
A major task which probably took years was clearing the dense forest into fields 
for growing crops. </p>
<p>Although there were relatively few residents in Bath Township at that time, 
the Bassitt family did not live in isolation. In 1835-36, properties just to the 
west of their farm were purchased by <a href="7.htm">John and Jonathan Lewis</a>, who are believed 
to be Elsie's brothers and at least Jonathan was living there by 1838. A number 
of the other farmers who lived in northwestern Bath Township were from Trumbull 
County and the community in that area was known informally as &quot;<a href="bes-tour.htm#lordstown">Lordstown</a>&quot;, 
presumably named after their previous home in northeastern Ohio. The connection 
with the Disciples church was also maintained in their new home. The Disciples 
were said to have erected the first church in Bath Township in about 1840.<sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup> </p>
<p>On 13 Nov 1840, at age 16 <a href="f.htm">Laura married Walter Edgecomb</a>, 
a son of <a href="2.htm">Uriah and Betsey Edgecomb</a> who lived nearby. This 
was the beginning of a close relationship between the Bassitt and Edgecomb 
families that would continue for years. </p>
<p>The early 1840's were a period of financial difficulty for Samuel. In May of 
1841, he mortgaged his farm to Thomas Kennedy for $60. On 25 March 1842, Samuel 
and Elsa sold 40 acres of their farm. This transaction was witnessed by Mary.<sup><a href="#15a">15a</a></sup>&nbsp; 
Records show that Thomas Kennedy foreclosed on his 
mortgage and on 18 Oct. 1842 he &quot;received debt and costs by purchase of land.&quot;<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup> 
Presumably the Bassitts continued to live on the farm despite the loss of 
ownership. <a href="images/cemeteries/wolfe-rd/bassett-mary.htm">By family 
tradition, Mary was said to have died at age 17</a> so she probably died about 
1843-44. </p>
<p>In the sparsely settled country there were probably few opportunities for 
subsistence farmers like the Bassitts to earn cash. According to family 
tradition, Lewis walked to and from the western edge of Allen County to work on 
construction of the Miami-Erie Canal. The canal was a major engineering feat 
considering the undeveloped state of the region and it opened officially in 
1845. After the completion of the canal, there may have been opportunities to 
sell crops to more populated parts of the country. In 1847, Samuel bought three 
acres on the southeast corner of section 11 (on the opposite side of the 
crossroads from the original farm) for $1500. On 13 April 1849, he was able to 
buy back the original eighty acre farm from the heirs of Thomas Kennedy, James 
and Martha Cunningham, for $500.<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup> </p>
<p>On 23 Dec. 1847, at the age of 21, <a href="l.htm">Lewis married Sarah 
Edgecomb</a> who had just turned 16, and was another child of Uriah<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup>. On 7 April 
1848, Lewis bought the southwest quarter of the southwest quarter of section 
twelve in Bath Township from the State of Ohio for $107.20.<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup> This 40 acre plot 
was just north of the family homestead on the other side of Bluelick Road and 
was part of the land that was granted to the State of Ohio to help finance the 
Miami-Erie Canal. </p>
<p>On 27 June 1850, one week after her eighteenth birthday, <a href="w.htm">Lavisa married 
Thomas Robinson Ward</a>. According to family tradition, they moved to Wisconsin. 
However, by the 1860s their family was living in Troy Mills, Linn Co., Iowa. </p>
<p>During the 1850s and 1860s, Lewis and Samuel bought more tracts of land in 
section 12 to the north of the original farms. </p>
<p>In about 1856, Samuel's brother, <a href="6.htm">William and his wife Susannah</a> moved from New 
York to Vaughnsville, Sugar Creek Township, Putnam Co., OH<sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup>. This is located 
about ten miles from the Bassitt homestead in Bath Township, so the brothers 
would have had opportunities to visit occasionally before William moved to 
Michigan in the 1860's.<sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup> </p>
<p>At the time of the 1860 census, three generations were living on the farm: 
Samuel, aged 64, Elsie, 63, <a href="l.htm">Lewis, 35, Sarah, 29,</a> and four children ranging from 
age 11 to 2.<sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup> </p>
<p>Like most other residents of Allen County at the time, the Bassitts were 
ardent Republicans and Lincoln supporters. After the Civil War broke out, they 
had a personal stake in the conflict. One of Samuel and Elsie's grandsons 
through their daughter Laura, <a href="f.htm">Lewis Alfred Edgecomb</a> was killed in July of 1864. 
So there was undoubtedly great trepidation when Lewis' oldest son Samuel, Jr. 
enlisted in the 27th Ohio Volunteer Infantry in 1864 at the age of 15. We know 
that Samuel and Elsie followed the conflict carefully through the letters that 
Sam sent them. By the end of the war in 1865, Samuel Sr. was on his deathbed. 
When Lincoln was assassinated on April 14, his family never told Samuel. He was 
such a &quot;red hot&quot; Republican that they were afraid that it would disturb him too 
much.<sup><a href="#23">23</a></sup> The precaution did not help because he died on April 16 and was buried in 
the <a href="bes-tour.htm#sproat">Sproat Cemetery on Wolfe Road</a><sup><a href="#24">24</a></sup>. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/14/G14-01-web.jpg" width="360" height="543"><br>
Elsa (Lewis) Bassitt</p>
<p>Elsie continued to live with Lewis and his family until her death on 9 Feb 
1876<sup><a href="#25">25</a></sup>. Originally the family had planned to bury her next to Samuel. However, 
due to bad weather, the stream to the south of the Wolfe Rd. cemetery was 
flooded and it was necessary to bury her in the <a href="bes-tour.htm#beaverdam">Old Beaverdam Cemetery</a><sup><a href="#23">23</a></sup>. </p>
